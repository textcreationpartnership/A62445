            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Have not uſed exactneſs of method in theſe my Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but have inſiſted as my Meditations lead me. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I garniſhed them with Rhetorical flouriſhes, or high ſtrains of Eloquution, but in plainneſs and ſimplicity of the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3.</note> Goſpel; to teach and affect the heart, and not to tickle the ear; or to bring Muſick in ſtead of meat. Where I have quoted the Texts in the Originals, or uſed Latine Sentences (which I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly avoided) I have rendered
<pb facs="tcp:37474:6"/> them all in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For I had rather ſpeak five words to edifie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 49.</note> than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue. I have kept to the letter and meaning of the Scripture: in ſundry places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining many Texts of Scripture; and have uſed Scripture-Phraſe and Expreſſions, which is far beſt of all. I have ſtrived to be as brief, yet as perſpicuous and clear as I might. Diverſities of ſtudies, with various cares and troubles attending the duties of my Profeſſion, have hindered me from licking over, and poliſhing theſe things. This I will promiſe, that as they are plain, ſo ſound and Orthodox.</p>
            <p>Divines have much the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which are free from other avocations, may and ought attend that very thing, giving themſelves wholly thereunto; to
<pb facs="tcp:37474:6"/> give attendance to Reading, to<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 15.</note> Exhortation, and to Doctrine; to faſten nails as the Maſters of<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 11.</note> Aſſemblies: ſo more is required of them.</p>
            <p>I have adventured to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with my Pen; first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it for the uſe of my family only; but becauſe it may be uſeful for weak Chriſtians, and inſtructing to the ignorant, (for whoſe ſake eſpecially I ſet it forth) being deſirous to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the glory of God, and do as much good as I may in my ſtation and generation.</p>
            <p>Toward the building of the material Tabernacle, Goats hair<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 4.</note> was commanded to be brought, and was accepted of God, as well as Gold and Silver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. The meaneſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were accepted, and the meaneſt might be uſeful. The
<pb facs="tcp:37474:7"/> poor widows two mites caſt into<note place="margin">Mark 12. 42.</note> the treaſury was accepted. God looks more to the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the giver, than to the<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 17.</note> greatneſs or quality of the gift. If this mean offering may be accepted and bleſſed of God, acceptable and profitable to thoſe that read or hear it, I have my deſire, and ſhall thank God for it. None was more unwilling than my ſelf to come in Print: Near forty years ſince I compiled a Geographical and Hiſtorical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the four parts of the world, yet could not be induced to Print it. But he writes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious books, doth (as one ſaid, <hi>Retia ſalutis expandere</hi>) ſpread the nets of Salvation, to catch ſouls in: and the good works of<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> ſuch, will laſt as long as their Books live, and follow them alſo after death.</p>

            <p>I cannot (<hi>Momo ſatisfacere,</hi> as the Proverb is) ſatisfie one who will do nothing himſelf, but carp and cavil at every thing another doth, whether deſervedly or undeſervedly.

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Ezek. 16. 8.</bibl>
                  <q>I entered into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God; and thou becameſt mine.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>GOd in this Chapter, by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> a Prieſt and a Prophet, declares His great mercies to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their horrid and vile ingratitude. Among all His mercies, this was none of the leaſt, that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Covenant with them.</p>
               <p>There are three things among men that do induce a publick obligation, and yet do differ in themſelves; As, 1. a Law. 2. A Covenant. 3. A Teſtament.</p>
               <p>A Law and a Teſtament are abſolute, and do not imply any conſent of the party under them. For a Law requires ſubjection, not expecting the conſent of inferiours: So a Teſtament, or a Will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37474:17"/> of a Man, is to bequeath ſuch Goods and Legacies, not expecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of others. But a Covenant requires conſent and agreement between two parties.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of God with man is twofold: 1. That of Works, which was made before the fall, with <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency. 2. The Covenant of Grace, which was made ſince the fall.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Works with <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, is laid down more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, than the Covenant of Grace was<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16, 17.</note> after the fall. <hi>And the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the man, ſaying, of every tree of the garden thou mayeſt freely eat; but of the tree of Knowledg of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do this and thou ſhalt live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> if thou do it not thou ſhalt dye. And ſo God enabled <hi>Adam</hi> to do that which was good; for the which, he was the more obliged unto God. Or thus, The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> promiſing him therein an everlaſting continuance of felicity and happineſs, under condition of his obedience unto God; but threatning death to him, if he were diſobedient.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37474:17"/>
               <p>This Covenant of Works was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a double Sacrament: 1. The tree of life. 2. The tree of knowledg of good and evil; both ſeated in the midſt of Paradiſe. The uſe of theſe was double.</p>
               <p>1. That by the uſe of the one, and by abſtaining from the other, man's obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience might be tryed.</p>
               <p>2. That the tree of life might Seal to man being obedient, his perpetuity of happineſs; and that the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of good and evil, might ſignifie unto man, if he were diſobedient, the loſs of the greateſt good, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing and procuring of the greateſt evil.</p>
               <p>The tree of life was not ſo called, from any inward implanted faculty of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it; but a Sacramental ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So alſo the tree of knowledg of good and evil, had this name from the ſignification of the greateſt evil or good, with the event and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof.</p>
               <p>Here in this Covenant needed no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, for it was before ſin was in the world: and <hi>Adam</hi> then was in perfect familiarity and communion with God.</p>
               <p>It was Sin that brought in enmity, fear, and ſhame; as well as puniſhment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37474:18"/> and death. For preſently after the fall, <hi>Adam</hi> hid himſelf from the preſence of the Lord, and feared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe of the guilt of Sin, and breach of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. So he confeſſed, <hi>I was afraid</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe I was naked, and hid my ſelf.</hi> Theſe are the grounds and reaſons to prove that God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> in theſe Commandments, by way of Covenant.</p>
               <p>1. From the evil threatned, and good promiſed.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe his poſterity became guilty of his Sin, and obnoxious and liable to his puniſhment.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 15, 18. makes all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> as believers are in Chriſt, which is by a foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or Covenant agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can God be ſaid to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or enter into promiſe with man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is of Gods great condeſcenſion ſo to do, in regard of His Soveraignty over man. And yet to give, and to promiſe to give, are acts of His domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and liberality; and ſo no ways repugnant to the great and glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God: But it is to confirm us in our hope and confidence in Him, and in our obedience unto Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth God deal with man
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37474:18"/> in a Covenant way, rather than in a meer ſupreme and abſolute way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To ſweeten and endear Himſelf unto us: So that <hi>Adam</hi> could not but have thankful and loving thoughts of God, that would thus far condeſcend unto him.</p>
               <p>2. To incite and encourage <hi>Adam</hi> the more to obedience, and that to a willing and free obedience.</p>
               <p>When our firſt Parents had broken this Covenant and were fallen; God out of His infinite pity, mercy, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mankind, made with them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant, a Covenant of Grace. And becauſe man was an ill-keeper; when he had his ſalvation in his own hands, he ſoon by Sin loſt it, and himſelf thereby.</p>
               <p>Therefore our gracious God would not have our Salvation any longer in our own keeping; but made this His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with man, in the hands of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> is therefore called the Angel of the Covenant; who will be ſure to preſerve and keep us, by the mighty power of God, through faith unto ſalvation.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And herein Gods unſpeakable mercy to manking appeared, <hi>not by works of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37474:19"/> righteouſneſs which we have done, but</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itus 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>according to His mercy He hath ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt, which He hath ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour: that being juſtified by His Grace, we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, before God pronounced the Curſe or Sentence of Judgment after <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, He graciouſly ſhewed a way, and a ſurer way of ſalvation in and through Chriſt the Mediator: when He ſaid, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this Covenant was firſt Preached by God to <hi>Adam;</hi> the Lord ſhewed him his Sin, and the curſe due for Sin; and then ſets an enmity between him and the ſerpent: they muſt fight it out, whereof the iſſue will be thus; A certain ſeed of the woman ſhall utterly overthrow Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, even breaking the head of that Serpent; but the Serpent ſhall only bruiſe His heel; which ſignified light and temporary afflictions, both in the Head, and alſo in the members of Chriſt the head.</p>
               <p>By virtue of which promiſe, the Church continued until <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37474:19"/> and then the Covenant is renewed: <hi>In</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The condition required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to believe; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 6.</note> God, and He counted it to him for righteouſneſs. Not that this was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s righteouſneſs before God; but that habit, that grace of faith (chiefly looking to the Meſſiah promiſed) that believing diſpoſition, whereby he was able to believe that promiſe, this was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſs;<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 2, 3.</note> which brings us to ſpeak of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace, is a mutual agreement between God and men: whereby God confirms unto men, that He will be favourable unto them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving them their Sins, and giving unto them new righteouſneſs, His Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and everlaſting life, by and through His Son our Mediator. And men oblige themſelves unto God, to receive ſo great benefits by lively faith, and to yield to God all true obedience.</p>
               <p>This mutual agreement between God and man, is confirmed by outward ſigns and ſeals, which we call Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Sacraments are holy ſigns teſtifying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37474:20"/> God's good-will toward us, and our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and duty towards God.</p>
               <p>This Covenant could not be made without a Mediator; for we could never make ſatisfaction, nor return into favour with God by and of our ſelves: Neither could God admit us for His juſtice ſake, without ſufficient ſatisfaction; which we could never make: For we were enemies to God, and ſo there was no way open for us to come unto God, but by that new and living way, namely the blood of Chriſt. So then this Reconciliation<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 20.</note> could never be made, but by the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and death of the Mediator.</p>
               <p>That on which all the promiſes now initially hang<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is nothing but believing. Who ſo now believeth in God, ſhall be put within the Covenant. And there are theſe four reaſons why all depends upon faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe true faith is never alone, but draws with it all other Graces: he that believes in God, hath a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God, and loves God; and he that loveth God muſt needs be full of good works.<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 17, 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Only faith makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſure unto us; otherwiſe Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace had been ſpared.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37474:20"/>
               <p>Thirdly, The Covenant conſiſts of promiſes: nothing but faith can anſwer this Covenant, which is not a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a Promiſe. Commandments are anſwered by obedience, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are anſwered by faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is by faith; becauſe God would have it go by free Grace, and not of debt: God dealeth with us as with Sons, and not as with Servants; He pays<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27. Rom. 11.</note> us not wages, but gives us an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So all boaſting is excluded.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the Covenant of Grace is this, That God will be our God, and give us everlaſting life in Chriſt Jeſus, if we receive Him by faith, being freely<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12. Jer. 31. 33. Acts 16. 30, 31:</note> by His Father offered unto us: where hence will follow new obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the faithful walk worthy of the Grace received; and this is alſo by the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>This God's eternal love and free Grace towards us, is the higheſt link of our ſalvation, both in order of time, nature, and cauſality. <hi>Whom He prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe alſo He called; and whom He called, thoſe He juſtified; and whom He juſtified, thoſe alſo He glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God loved us when we were Sinners, enemies to Him, and that by wicked

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:37474:22"/> works. If our wicked works could not<note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> prevent the love of God to us, why ſhould we think they can nullify or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it? if the maſs, guilt, and greatneſs of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin (in which all men were equally ſharers) could not interrupt or fruſtrate God's counſel of loving us when we were His enemies; why ſhould any other Sins over-turn the ſtability of the ſame love and counſel, when we are become His Sons, and have a Spirit given us to bewail and lament our Sins?</p>
               <p>It was God's promiſe flowing from this everlaſting love that cauſed Him to make an everlaſting Covenant with us, that He would not turn away from us to do us good.</p>
               <p>But though God turn not away from us, oh how apt are we to turn away from Him! Nay, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> God inclines our hearts to do thoſe things which He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth; and ſo by over-powring our ſtubborn and perverſe wills, He makes us to be a willing people in the day of His power.<note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, This Covenant of Grace is one in ſubſtance: for there is one God, one Mediator between God and men, even
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37474:22"/> Chriſt Jeſus, one manner of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 12. Joh. 14. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 8. 56.</note> one faith, one way of ſalvation; and that for all thoſe that are ſaved ſince the beginning of the world, or ſhall be ſaved to the end of it. So the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is one, according to the principal conditions; whereby,</p>
               <p>1. God obligeth Himſelf to us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing remiſſion of Sins to all thoſe who repent and believe; and we do bind our ſelves to believe in God, and act repentance.</p>
               <p>2. But according to the leſs principal conditions, or (as others ſay) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtration; ſo they are two Covenants, the Old, and the New; the firſt and the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein do the two Covenants agree, <hi>viz.</hi> this old and new?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. They agree in the author, God; and in the Mediator, Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. In the promiſe of Grace; which is, of pardon of Sin, and life everlaſting, freely given to thoſe that believe by and through Chriſt: which promiſe of Grace was common to the Saints of old, as well as unto us; although now it is more clear, and more often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
               <p>3. In the condition in reſpect of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37474:23"/> us. In both, God required faith and obedience. So to <hi>Abraham, Walk before</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1. Mark. 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>me, and be upright:</hi> And to us, <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> So the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant agrees with the old, according to the principal conditions, both in reſpect of God, and alſo of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein the new Covenant and the old do differ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. In corporal promiſes: as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed to the Jews; their form of ceremonial Worſhip, and their outward political Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Chriſt came: Chriſt to be of their ſeed: and many other ſuch-like. But the new Covenant hath not ſuch ſpecial corporal promiſes; but only in general, that God will preſerve His Church to the end of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the circumſtances of the promiſe of Grace: In the old Covenant they were received into Grace and favour, upon believing in Chriſt that was to come: In the new Covenant, we are received into Grace and favour, by believing in Chriſt that is already come.</p>
               <p>3. In the rights and ſigns added to the promiſe of Grace; for in the old Covenant there were other Sacraments
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37474:23"/> various, chargeable, painful; as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Paſſeover, Oblations, Sacrifices. But in the new Covenant, there are fewer Sacraments, and they more ſimple, as Baptiſm, and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord.</p>
               <p>4. In the clearneſs; in the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant all were typical, and under ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, as their Prieſts, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo all things were obſcure. But in the New Covenant, all things are clearer, both in Doctrine and in Sacraments; we having the fulfilling of the types.</p>
               <p>5. The old Covenant and the new do differ in gifts: heretofore it was more narrow and ſparing: now a more large<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Cor. 3. 9. Joel. 2. 28.</note> and plentiful effuſion of the Graces of the Spirit. <hi>I will make a new Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord; I will write My Law in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be My people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will pour out My Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. In the time: the old Covenant was but temporary, until the coming of the Meſſiah: The new Covenant is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. In obliging: the old Covenant obliged the people to all the Law, both
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37474:24"/> both Moral, Ceremonial, and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. The new Covenant obligeth us only to the Moral Law, and to the uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>8.

               <p>1. Then take we heed of refuſing this acceptable time, and this day of Salvation. Now the door is open, let us come in thereat: and joyn our ſelves to the Lord, to be His Covenant-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that for ever: taking the Lord to be our God; to love, ſerve, and fear Him, and to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>2. The cauſe why God enters into Covenant with us, is as becauſe He loves<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> us, ſo to give us ſtrong conſolation, that He will do us good, and make us for to know it. Labour we therefore for more knowledg of God in Chriſt; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37474:24"/> the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 8, 19.</note> and to be filled with all the fulneſs of God. For there may be knowledg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace; but there can be no Grace without knowledg.</p>
               <p>Then may we comfort our ſelves in applying the promiſes of the Covenant to our ſelves; as to inſtance in theſe three promiſes only; As,</p>
               <p>1: Of Juſtification; when Sin lyes heavy on thy Conſcience, lay claim to the Covenant, wherein God hath ſaid, <hi>Their ſins and iniquities I will remember no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Of Sanctification; if a luſt be too ſtrong for thee, and thou wouldſt fain be rid of it; go to God and beſeech Him to make good His Covenant in this reſpect, to deliver thee from all thine enemies, to write His Law in thy heart, to give thee a new heart; to pour clean<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25, 26.</note> water upon thee, (even the ſanctifying Graces of His holy Spirit) and from all thy filthineſſes to cleanſe thee. And then (as He ſaid to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) His Grace<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 6.</note> ſhall be ſufficient for thee.</p>
               <p>3. Of outward bleſſings and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; in every ſtreight, want, danger, diſeaſe, or the like; plead hard with God, tell Him of His Covenant, pray
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37474:25"/> Him to be thy buckler, and to deliver thee, to ſupply all thy need, and to be a preſent help unto thee in thy needful time of trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The promiſes are full of conſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thou muſt ſuck hard at theſe breaſts of conſolation, and draw them out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 66. 11.</note> And ſo make uſe of the promiſes to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtayed himſelf upon the promiſe, when he was in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and in very much fear of his rough brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> he urged God with his promiſe, <hi>Lord thou haſt ſaid, Thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 12. &amp; 28. 13, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>wilt ſurely do me good; deliver me I pray thee,</hi> &amp;c. So do thou as <hi>Jacob</hi> there did, wreſtle with God in Prayer, and give Him not over until He bleſs thee.</p>
               <p>So <hi>David</hi> prays to God, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect<note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 10.</note> to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> likewiſe prayeth, <hi>Do not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>abhor us for Thy Names ſake; Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, break not Thy Covenant with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So look to the Covenant and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, build upon them, hold them faſt, and be aſſured that in God's good time, (though perhaps not in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired time) all ſhall be fulfilled. And God will either give thee the mercy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37474:25"/> deſired, or that which is better for thee.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider the miſery of all thoſe who are not in Covenant with God. They <hi>are without God in the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> and have no hope; they have no right to one of the promiſes; wicked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſubject to many wants, and need much aſſiſtance from God, and yet can have no confidence to go unto God.</p>
               <p>Oh that pitiful ſpeech of <hi>Saul! I am</hi>

                  <hi>ſore diſtreſſed, for the Philiſtins make war againſt me, and God is departed from me, and anſwereth me no more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yea, as they have no comfort from God, ſo God is their enemy, a devouring fire unto them, everlaſting burnings, quickly and eaſily conſuming them as ſtubble; yea, and all the creatures are at enmity with them, becauſe they are at enmity with God. All Men, Beaſts, and Devils may hurt them, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition againſt them; for wicked men have no intereſt in God by Covenant, and ſo are out of His more eſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. God oftentimes lets looſe the creatures againſt them, go, and worry them, wound them, hurt them, be an enemy unto them, deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Afflictions to thoſe that are not in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37474:26"/> Covenant with God, are as a cup of poiſon, and as a ſword for their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The bread and meat which they eat, may choak them: Though they have a civil right before men, yet they are uſurpers before God, of all their Lands and Eſtates, and of all the good things of the world which they have and do enjoy.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, I might largely ſpeak of the comforts, bleſſedneſs, ſecurity, and happineſs of all thoſe who have a Covenant-intereſt in God, and who can truly ſay to the Lord, <hi>O Lord, thou art my God.</hi> Read <hi>Job.</hi> 25. 23. to the end. As God is faithful in keeping Covenant with us, let us be faithful in keeping Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>In Covenants between men, there is uſually a league offenſive and defenſive, to defend and help each other. Let God's enemies be our enemies; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that</hi>

                  <hi>hate thee? and am not I grieved at thoſe that riſe up againſt thee?

Side not with any ungodly ſpeeches, courſes, or practiſes. As God is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> to make us His people, and to be called our God; ſo let not us be afraid or aſhamed to make it good upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Elſe if we be aſhamed of Chriſt and His words here, of us will He be aſhamed when He comes in the glory of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Mark 8. 38.</note> with His holy Angels. Eſpecially let us take heed we be not a ſhame to Chriſt, and our Chriſtian profeſſion by ungodly or unſuitable lives. We have great cauſe of admiration, that the great and glorious and moſt holy God, would enter into Covenant with us ſuch vile miſerable and ſinful creatures; and ſo to oblige Himſelf unto us to do us good.</p>
               <p>As God is ours, ſo all that is in God is ours, and for our good. He provides<note place="margin">Iſai. 54. 13. &amp; 48. 17.</note> for us for Soul and Body.

               <p>1. By his promiſe, which is a ſure word. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be of Grace, to the end the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> might be ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By His oath: God willing more abundantly to ſhew to the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the immutability of His counſel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things (that is, His Word, and His Oath) in which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By the death of His Son, the blood of Chriſt. For where a Teſtament is,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37474:27"/> there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 16.</note> of the Teſtator.</p>
               <p>By the ſeals of the Sacraments; which is not ſo much, to confirm the promiſes on God's part; but to help our faith to believe them, and to rely upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may we know if we are in Covenant with God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By faith: <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and was reckoned to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; and ſo he was called<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3.</note> the friend of God. But this muſt be a true lively working faith; a faith that ſhews it ſelf by its good works. This<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> faith purifies the heart.</p>
               <p>2. If we be in Chriſt, and have His Spirit, for <hi>if any have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of His.</hi> This holy Spirit makes us like unto God, and ſo teſtifies with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God: and alſo that we are partakers of the Covenant. After that we believe in Chriſt, we are ſealed with<note place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37474:28"/> hath it. It is better felt, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>3. We may know if we be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, by our own knowledg. After God had rehearſed the Covenant<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 34.</note> there, He adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>And they ſhall all know Me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>True knowledg of God in Chriſt, firſt makes us to put off the old man with his deeds, and to be renewed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our mind, and to put on the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</note> which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; and which is renewed in knowledg after the image of Him that created Him. And 2. It worketh in us a readineſs and<note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> willingneſs to obey God, and to ſerve Him: when we are brought out of the ſlavery of Satan, and from the bondage of ſin and corruption, that ſin doth not reign over us; then will we run the<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> ways of God's Commandments, and that with alacrity and chearfulneſs, not thinking it a burden; run and not be<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 32. Iſai. 40. 31.</note> weary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walk and not faint. They who are thus in Covenant with God, have a ſpecial intereſt in Him, and have acceſs with boldneſs to the throne of Grace (through our great High-Prieſt Jeſus the Son of God) that they may obtain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37474:28"/> mercy, and find Grace to help in time<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 14, 16.</note> of need.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> after God had ſo entred into Covenant with him, refuſed the King of <hi>sodom</hi> and his gifts, wholly relying on God's Covenant for His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and ſaid, <hi>I have lifted up my hand</hi>

                  <hi>unto the Lord the moſt high God, the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth; that I will not take from a thred, even to a ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet, and that I will take any thing that is the King of Sodoms; leſt thou ſhouldſt ſay, I have made</hi> Abraham <hi>rich.</hi>

               <p>I can never ſufficiently magnifie and admire the eternal love of God to me in Chriſt; that He hath choſen me in Him, before the foundation of the world, that I ſhould be holy and unblameable before Him in love: having predeſtinated me<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5.</note> unto the adoption of a Child by Jeſus Chriſt unto Himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of His will: and hath entered into Covenant with me, and ſo<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 8.</note> hath made me to become His own.

               <p>There is a mutual promiſe and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation between God and me, and all other true believers, that God for ever will be the God of His people, and of their poſterity alſo (if they walk in God's ways, and make not void His Covenant). And they again promiſe and oblige themſelves to God, to be His people, to keep His Covenant, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Him, and obeying His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p>Let all thoſe that truly endeavour to keep Covenant with God, beware of Covenant-breaking; if they fail that way, be duly humbled for it; and be more watchful and wary for the future; ſtriving to recover themſelves by ſerious and renewed repentance.</p>
               <p>Let them ſet God always before their<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 8.</note> eyes, endeavouring to walk before Him<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> and to be perfect. The meaning is, let them bear God always in their mind, as preſent with them, reſt themſelves by faith on Him alone, depend upon His
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37474:31"/> Providence, and regulate all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions according to His Will revealed in His Word.

               <p>And ſo in reference to our part of the Covenant, it is as much as if God had ſaid, I will be He alone whom thou ſhalt ſerve, acknowledge and worſhip as God, and upon whom alone thou ſhalt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depend, forſaking all others.</p>
               <p>For ſo the words of the Covenant are, <hi>I will put My Law in their inward</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſetteth out God's eternity, in that it contains all times, to come, or preſent or paſt. The 3 ſyllables in the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> contain the notes of all times.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVHat is a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A Sacrament is an Ordinance of God, wherein by giving and receiving of outward Elements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Will, the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace made in the blood of Chriſt, being repreſented, exhibited, and applyed unto us, are farther ſigned and ſealed betwixt God and Man.</p>
                  <p>Sacraments are ſeals annexed to the<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> Covenant of Grace to inſtruct, aſſure,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> and poſſeſs us of our part in Chriſt and His benefits, and to bind us to all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> obedience to God in Him; that we<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note> ſhould walk in newneſs of life. God alone is the Author of a Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He alone can beſtow thoſe Graces which are ſealed therein.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:37474:35"/>
                  <p>There be two only Sacraments in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>1. Baptiſm. 2. The Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is a Sacrament of our entrance into the Covenant of Grace: the Lords Supper is a Sacrament of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein.</p>
                  <p>The other five Sacraments of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as Matrimony, Orders, Extreme Unction, Penance, and Confirmation, do want an outward ſign and inſtitution by Chriſt, and ſo be no ſeals of ſaving Grace. I could ſeverally and diſtinctly prove thoſe five to be no Sacraments, but then I ſhould be too prolix.</p>
                  <p>The word Sacrament is not uſed in all the New Teſtament, it is here taken for a Divine Myſteric propounded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by outward ſigns and figures, or ſymbols. This ſignification in the word Sacrament is fitly anſwered, and is borrowed by the Latin Eccleſiaſtical Writers, from Military buſineſſes; in which, the Oath that Soldiers took, and were obliged by to their General, was called a Sacrament. This may aptly and ſitly be ſo uſed here; for in our Baptiſm by our Sureties (until we come of age to perform it our ſelves) we oblige and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37474:35"/> bind our ſelves by a ſolemn vow, to our great Captain and General the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to fight under His banner, againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, and to continue His faithful Soldiers and Servants to our lives end.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the words uſed by every <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier in his Oath, <hi>Obtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus ſum, &amp; facturus, quioquid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabitur ab imperatoribus, juxta vires.</hi> And theſe were termed <hi>milites per Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a myſterie, or a hidden ſecret belonging to holy things, known but to few, and not to be communicated but to thoſe that are initiated or let into the Church. From <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſacris initior</hi> or <hi>inſtituor doctrinâ quae ad res ſacras pertinet,</hi> I am inſtructed in the Doctrine concerning holy things. But the word Myſterie is of larger acceptation than Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>A Sacrament is called a Myſterie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſignifieth ſecret things, and ſuch things as are unknown to thoſe who have not been taught out of the Word of God, concerning the ſignification and uſe of them; and becauſe there one thing is ſeen, and another thing is meant.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:37474:36"/>
                  <p>The lawful uſe of the Sacraments is not the obſervation of the external Rite, but to have faith to reſerve the Rite it ſelf, to that end to which it was ordained by God.</p>
                  <p>For to the Sacraments of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace no other promiſe is annexed or added, but the promiſe of Grace, which hath always the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith with it, either expreſſed or implyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith is the inſtrument, <hi>medium,</hi> or hand, by which the things ſignified and offered by God, are received both in the Word, and alſo in the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt Himſelf by His Spirit doth make the things promiſed, preſent to our faith, and ſo faith receiveth them.</p>
                  <p>In the right uſe of the Sacrament, the giving and receiving the ſign and thing ſignified, is joyned and goes together.</p>
                  <p>The giving and receiving of the ſign is bodily by the hand of the Miniſter and receiver; but the giving and receiving of the thing ſignified is ſpiritual, through true faith in the receiver, and by the hand of Chriſt Himſelf giving it.</p>
                  <p>A Sacrament in proper ſpeech, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole action, as well the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37474:36"/> ſign as the thing ſignified. But by a Synechdoche it is taken only for the ſign, the outward viſible ſign of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inviſible and ſpiritual Grace.</p>
                  <p>The outward and earthly matter of the Sacrament, is, the viſible ſign or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The inward and heavenly matter of the Sacrament, is, the things ſignified, Chriſt with all His benefits.</p>
                  <p>The external form conſiſteth in the lawful adminiſtration and participation of the Sacrament according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</p>
                  <p>The inward form is in the Analogy, proportion or union of the ſign, and the thing ſignified; which is a ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whereby the things ſignified are really communicated to them who rightly receive and uſe the ſigns.</p>
                  <p>The Sacraments are ſigns in a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reſpect,</p>
                  <p>1 Signifying. 2 Exhibiting. 3 Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sealing.</p>
                  <p>1. The outward ſigns in the Sacrament do ſignifie or repreſent the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Together with the ſign, the thing ſignified is exhibited and given; yet not in the ſign or element, but in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37474:37"/> action, the Miniſter giving the ſign or element, but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gives the thing ſignified.</p>
                  <p>3. The thing ſignified in the Word of the Goſpel generally promiſed to all true believers, is applyed to every believing Soul, the outward ſign or element being exhibited and given unto them.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſame promiſe is ſealed in the Sacrament, whence it is they are not called ſigns only, but ſeals alſo. So we have it in the Word, <hi>Abraham received</hi>

                  <p>There are three things required in a Sacrament. 1. The outward ſigns and ſacramental actions concerning the ſame. 2. The inward things ſignified thereby, namely, Chriſt Jeſus with His ſaving Graces: and Spiritual actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rning the ſame. 3. A ſimilitude and likeneſs between them both.</p>
                  <p>As for example, In Baptiſm as water doth waſh away the filth of the Body, ſo the blood of Chriſt doth waſh away the ſpots of the Soul. As the bread and wine do nouriſh and feed the Body, ſo the body and blood of Chriſt laid hold on by true and lively faith, do nouriſh and cheriſh the Soul to eternal life.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:37474:37"/>
                  <p>The ſigns uſed in the Sacraments, are either, 1. Repreſenting, as Water, Bread and Wine. Or, 2. Applying, as waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eating, drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſigns and the things ſignified in both Sacraments do ſo agree, that the ſign doth ſo fitly repreſent the things ſignified thereby, that the mind of a Chriſtian is drawn by the ſigns to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the things thereby ſignified. The ends of Sacraments are, the ſealing of the Covenant of Grace; or more fully thus in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. To help our underſtanding, and inſight; therefore the Sacraments are as clear glaſſes. So the Apoſtle ſaid to<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in regard of the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Chriſt was crucified before their eyes; that is, Sacramentally, in the breaking of the Bread, and pouring forth of the Wine: whereas we know that corporally Chriſt was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was far diſtant from the region of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To help our memories, to bring to our remembrance, as laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Do this</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>in</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>remembrance of Me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. To perſwade our hearts, and to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37474:38"/> confirm our faith, as moſt certain ſeals and pledges to aſſure and ſtrengthen us in the promiſes of Salvation; which God hath not only made to us in word, but confirmed it by writing; and leſt we ſhould any ways doubt (as naturally we are inclined to do) therefore He hath ſet to His ſeals, that nothing may be lacking to increaſe and ſtrengthen our faith: from whence the Sacraments become not only marks and pledges of our Chriſtian profeſſion; but alſo ſo many bonds to bind us to obedience.</p>
                  <p>So that hereby not only the free Grace of God, and the promiſes are ſealed to us on Gods part; but alſo our thankfulneſs and obedience towards God.</p>
                  <p>This is the primary end of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the ſecondary end is, the profeſſion of our faith and charity.</p>
                  <p>For there are repreſented in our uſe of the Sacraments, not only that union which we have with God in Chriſt; but alſo that communion which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with all thoſe who are partakers of the ſame union with us.</p>
                  <p>We muſt underſtand and believe that the efficacy of the Sacrament is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the external element, but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37474:38"/> wholly comes from the good Spirit of God, as He is pleaſed to ſhew His mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt power by thoſe inſtruments, that ſo He may help our weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>For if we were wholly ſpiritual as the Angels are, then we ſhould be able ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to contemplate God and His gifts; but now ſith we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with this lump of our earthly body, it is neceſſary that God ſhould by certain figures, as it were by glaſſes (as I ſaid before) repreſent unto us ſpiritual and heavenly things, who cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conceive of them in our minds. <hi>For now we ſee as through a glaſs</hi>

                  <p>4. For the whole work and action of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>6. The native and proper ſignification is, to dip into water, or to plunge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, <hi>tanquam ad tingendum mergo. Acts</hi> 8. 38. <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch went down both into the water. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Baptiſm repreſents unto us two things.</p>
                  <p>1. The forgiveneſs of Sins. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual regeneration.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:37474:40"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what proportion hath water with theſe, that it ſhould be a ſign of theſe things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe the remiſſion of ſins is in a ſence like unto a laver; whereby the ſinfulneſſes and defilements which are in our minds are cleanſed, as the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of our body is waſhed away with water.</p>
                  <p>2. The beginning of our regeneration is, that our nature ſhould be mortified; as the end is, that we ſhould be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures: the pouring of water ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a death, and in that runs away from us, and we remain not under it, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a return unto life; as the words in our Church-Catechiſm are, <hi>a death unto ſin, and a new-birth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> So ſaid the Apoſtle, buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, wherein alſo we are riſen with Him through faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>God who uſually accompanies His own Ordinance with His bleſſing, will not fruſtrate our expectation in any of thoſe good things which He hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; therefore we muſt ſtrive to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that remiſſion of ſins and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or a renewedneſs of life, by Baptiſm is offered unto us, and that we receive it therein. In as much as by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37474:40"/> Baptiſm we are incorporated into Chriſt, and receive His Holy Spirit, unleſs we reject the promiſes there made unto us, and ſo render them unprofitable to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The right uſe of Baptiſm is placed in faith and repentance; if thou wouldſt uſe Baptiſm aright as it ſhould be, then repent and believe; ſo we read in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of the Goſpels, and alſo in the Acts of the Apoſtles: that is, that we be perſwaded that we are purged by the blood of Chriſt from our ſins, and be ſenſible that we have His holy Spirit dwelling in us: and ſo daily to meditate of mortifying our corrupt fleſh, and of yielding obedience to all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, by the waſhing of water repreſenting the powerful waſhing of<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26.</note> the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.

                  <p>This Sacramental waſhing ſealeth to thoſe that are within Gods Covenant, their birth in Chriſt, and entrance into Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:37474:41"/>
                  <p>The Covenant which is in general to all believers, is in Baptiſm eſpecially made and eſtabliſhed with every one of the faithful. And it is always ratified and ſure, even to them that fall, when they do repent. (Although <hi>Novatus</hi> and his Sect taught otherwiſe). Neither do they enter into a new Covenant after their falls; but that which was entered into, is reſtored, renewed, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med again. We muſt often meditate on, and conſider of the Covenant made and entered into in our Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm came in place of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and keepeth analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it; for both of them were a Sacrament of entrance, or of receiving into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm came in place of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;</p>
                  <p>1. By the command of God: God ſent <hi>John</hi> to baptize with water; ſo we have it <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33.</p>
                  <p>2. By the Miniſtry of <hi>John:</hi> therefore he was called <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; ſo we have it, <hi>Mat. 3. 1, In thoſe days came John the Baptiſt preaching in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. It was ſanctified and confirmed by our Saviour Chriſt Himſelf, being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 3. 13.</p>

                  <p>Every faithful perſon that is baptized, receiveth the outward Baptiſm of water, that there may be ſignified and ſealed up unto him, that he is aſſuredly waſhed from his ſins by the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt, as ſurely as his body is ſprinkled or waſhed with water. <hi>Then will I</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To be waſhed with the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt, ſignifieth, to be made partakers of the Covenant of Grace; namely, to be reconciled to God, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, regenerated, adopted, to be the Son or Child of God, and to be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the freedom of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>All are waſhed with water, but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only by the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Therefore not all that are baptized re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion of ſins and regeneration, but the believers only.

To the receiving of the Sacrament (as very worthily it is in our Liturgy) there muſt be adjoyned thankſgiving, which is preſently performed by every perſon that is baptized, if he be adult or of years of diſcretion; or by the witneſſes in his ſtead if he be an infant, who when he comes to years of diſcretion, all his life long ought to be thankful unto God for this benefit.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> What are the ends of Baptiſm?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Eſpecially theſe four.</p>

                  <p>3. To mind us of repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our lives: for we are baptized with water unto repentance.<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note>

                  <p>4. To be ſealed to the certain hope of reſurrection, and of an eternal bleſſed life.</p>
                  <p>In Baptiſm, Original ſin is waſhed and taken away, eſpecially as concerning the guilt, that is to ſay, the fault and the puniſhment; there remaining not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vitiation and the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, namely, wicked luſts and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to evil: and that to this end, that we might all our life long fight againſt ſin, and the Devil who is the Author of ſin. But the Papiſts ſay, that by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm rightly adminiſtred, not only the guiltineſs, but alſo the corruption of Original ſin is ſo waſhed away, as that it is not afterward properly accounted a ſin. But we contrarily diſtinguiſh thus of ſin; ſin in regard of the guiltineſs or obnoxiouſneſs to the wrath of God, and alſo in regard of the puniſhment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by one act is taken away in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But in regard of that error and corruption of Nature, it is not at the firſt wholly taken away, but ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by little and little, or by degrees it is extinguiſhed, even as our renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or renewing by the Holy Ghoſt is by little and little begun, increaſed and carried on in us.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arguments. </seg>
                     </label> 1. Becauſe Infants are comprehended in the Covenant of the Grace of God; and therefore both the faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37474:46"/> themſelves, and alſo of the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 14.</note> is confirmed by this ſign, that God will be the God and Saviour as of the faithful Parents, ſo of their ſeed and children: which promiſe of His, He at His good<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29, 30. Tit. 3. 5.</note> time performeth in His elect.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe to them belongeth alſo the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins, through the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe they belong to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe they are redeemed by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe to them is promiſed the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>6. Becauſe they are to be diſcerned from the Children of Infidels.</p>
                  <p>7. Becauſe in the Old Teſtament In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were circumciſed. As Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was then the firſt beginning or initiating Sacrament into the Jewiſh Church, ſo is Baptiſm the firſt beginning of Chriſtianity. There can be no reaſon given to deprive Infants of Baptiſm, but that which may be given againſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; the main whereof is, the incapableneſs of Infants of the Grace of the Sacraments. But He that ſaid of Infants, to them belongs the Kingdom of God, knows how to ſettle upon them the title of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:37474:46"/>
                  <p>And we have no reaſon to think, but that even before, or in, at, or by, the act of Baptiſm, the Spirit of Chriſt doth unite the Soul of the elect Infant unto Chriſt, and cloath it with His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and impute unto it the title of a Son or a Daughter by adoption, and the Image of God by Sanctification, and ſo fit it for the ſtate of Glory.</p>
                  <p>8. To them to whom the Covenant belongs, to them belongs the ſeal of the Covenant that confirms the right to them: But to the Infants of faithful Parents the Covenant belongs; to you<note place="margin">Acts 2. 39.</note> and to your Children are the promiſes<note place="margin">Mark. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> made; and to them belongs the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Therefore we rationally conclude, that if the thing it ſelf belongs to them, therefore the ſign and ſeal thereof.</p>
                  <p>9. Your Children are Holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. there is a faederal Sanctity, or an external and viſible Holineſs, at leaſt in Children of believing Parents: and they are to be judged of the true flock of Chriſt, until they ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                     </label> But the Anabaptiſts urge, we have no rule or example in Holy Scripture for the baptizing of Infants?</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:37474:47"/>
                  <p>We read of nothing in Scripture that<note place="margin">Solution.</note> doth infringe the liberty of the Church therein, neither do the Scriptures afford any proofs by conſequence of it, to deter from it. We read of ſeveral whole houſholds baptized, doubtleſs ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were therein.</p>
                  <p>And if the Scriptures not expreſſing directly the baptizing of Infants, were a ſufficient reaſon of denying that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, is a ſenſeleſs thing.</p>
                  <p>Circumciſion was a ſign of repentance (<hi>Deut. 10. 16. Jer.</hi> 4. 14.) and a ſign of faith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.) and yet Infants were not kept from Circumciſion, but God commanded them to be circumciſed the eighth day, which is a ſufficient ground to us for baptizing of Infants. For the ancient promiſes of God to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> belong now to every believer in any Nation whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Sith God under the Law ſhewed Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Saviour of Infants, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be ſigned with ſuch a viſible ſign as Circumciſion was; it would be a very grievous and a hard thing if the Children of believers now under the Goſpel, ſince the coming of Chriſt, ſhould have leſs priviledg, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the fathers of old, ſeeing the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37474:47"/> ſame promiſe is to us as was to them. And God hath now more manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared His goodneſs to us in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The promiſe belongs to Infants:<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> would have his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to repent and to be baptized, and he adds the reaſon, becauſe the promiſe belonged to them and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence I argue, becauſe they are partakers of the promiſe, therefore they are bid to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, the promiſe belongs to the adult repentant perſons and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Infants: therefore adult repentant perſons and their Children or Infants are to be baptized for remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>The adult (or thoſe of years) are to be baptized upon their repentance: and the Children or Infants of thoſe repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized perſons, yea, before they are actually capable of repentance, are to be baptized alſo, for the promiſe is made unto them upon the account of their Parents.</p>
                  <p>So St. <hi>Peter</hi> there, commands them to be baptized, and why? becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made unto them.</p>
                  <p>So alſo he ſhews the cauſe why thoſe adult repentant perſons are commanded to be baptized: which is, not becauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37474:48"/> they were adult or repentant, and ſo Baptiſm belonged only to them: but alſo it belonged to their Infants; and ſo he proveth that as well the Infants as the adult ſhould be baptized. Not becauſe they believe or do not believe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are partakers of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Regeneration or receiving into Grace, is enough for Infants.</p>
                  <p>Much more might have been ſaid to ſeveral others of their arguments which are many, and would digreſs into a large volume; but I ſhall dwell no longer hereon.</p>
                  <p>Although we be but once baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Baptiſm is unto us a perpetual Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our waſhing from ſin, and of our regeneration: that is to ſay, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth not only evacuate and waſh away Original Sin (in the ſence before premiſed) but alſo all other Sins, either paſt, or preſent: for they that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, are baptized into Chriſt's death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now Chriſt's death is available not only to waſh away thoſe Sins that are before Baptiſm, but thoſe alſo in our whole life which follow Baptiſm.</p>

Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very action of ſprinkling water very warrantable, eſpecially in young Children, to whom farther wetting may be dangerous to them.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons are ſuch as theſe,</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe neither dipping nor ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is eſſential to the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: but only waſhing and applying wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the body, as a cleanſer of the filth thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. As in the other Sacrament (that of the Lord's Supper) a ſpoonful of Wine is as ſignificant as a whole gallon; ſo here a handful of water is as ſignificant as a whole river.</p>
                  <p>3. The action of ſprinkling bears fit reſemblance with the inward Grace, as well as dipping; and hath authority alſo in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>We read of ſprinkling of the blood<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2. Heb. 12. 14.</note> of Chriſt: and <hi>the blood of ſprinkling which ſpeaketh better things than the blood of Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:37474:49"/>
                  <p>4. It is not unlikely that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles baptized as well by ſprinkling or pouring water upon, as by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into it. Sith we read of dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> baptized in houſes as well as in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. However the waſhing of the body with water is eſſential, though<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26.</note> whether way it be done ſeems not to be eſſential, ſo water be applyed to the body for the cleanſing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How do Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm agree?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In the principal end: for the promiſe of Grace through and by Chriſt (which was the ſame in all ages) is ſealed in both of them.</p>
                  <p>2. In both is ſignified regeneration, and a promiſe of faith and obedience towards God.</p>
                  <p>3. Both Circumciſion and Baptiſm are the Sacrament of our reception and entrance into the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein do Circumciſion and Baptiſm differ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In the Rite or Ceremony, which is not the ſame in Baptiſm as in Circumciſion: for in Baptiſm is only a waſhing, but in Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a cutting off the foreakin of the fleſh.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:37474:49"/>
                  <p>2. In the circumſtance of the ſex or age: Circumciſion belonged only to Males, and at eight days old; Baptiſm belongs to both ſexes Male and Female, and preſently after they are born.</p>
                  <p>3. In the manner of ſignifying: Circumciſion (on God's part) promiſed Grace, through the Meſſiah to come; but Baptiſm through Chriſt already come. And (on their part) they being Circumciſed were received into Grace, by believing on the Meſſiah to come; but we through faith in Him already come.</p>
                  <p>4. In the particular promiſe: Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had alſo the promiſe of corporal bleſſings, as of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. But Baptiſm hath no ſuch ſpecial promiſe of any temporal benefit.</p>
                  <p>5. In the manner of obliging: Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion on their part obliged them to the keeping of the whole Law, Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral; but Baptiſm obligeth us only to the keeping of the Moral Law, that is, to faith and repentance.</p>
                  <p>6. In the objects and duration: Circumciſion was commanded to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37474:50"/> poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> only, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and was to endure but till the coming of Chriſt: Baptiſm is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for all Nations that will come into the ſociety of the Church, and to endure to the end of the world. To cloſe up all with theſe few heads.</p>

                  <head>Aphoriſms about Baptiſm.</head>
                  <p>1. Baptiſm avails though adminiſtred by a contemptible perſon, as much as if it were adminiſtred by an Apoſtle; for if Baptiſm were in the merit or worth of the Miniſter, then it did not belong unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. The power of baptizing the Lord hath reſerved to Himſelf, it is Chriſt alone that baptizes with the Holy Ghoſt: the applying of the outward Element Chriſt hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to His Miniſters lawfully called and deputed.</p>
                  <p>3. Baptiſm is the ſame as He is by whoſe power and authority it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred: Not as He is by whom it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>4. Every true believer in Baptiſm is made a King, and a Prieſt and Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. Chriſt waſhes us
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37474:50"/> from our ſins in His own blood, and ſo makes us Kings and Prieſts unto God and His Father. So St. <hi>Cryſoſtome,</hi> When as Chriſt hath waſhed us from our ſins (in the laver of Baptiſm) by His blood, He makes us Kings and Prieſts unto God.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm, as we have ſeen, is a high Ordinance of God, and a means whereby He hath appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Chriſt and His benefits to our Souls: and therefore not to be neglected or ſlightly eſteemed, but uſed with all reverence and thankful devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it may be had. Yet where God denyeth it, either in regard of the ſhortneſs of the Infants life, or by any other unavoidable neceſſity; there comes no danger from the want of Sacraments, but only from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them.</p>
                  <p>The right uſe of Baptiſm is, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in thy heart thou feeleſt ſome motion to ſin, through thy luſts, then meditate on that ſolemn vow thou madeſt to God in thy Baptiſm. And if by infirmity thou falleſt once or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into ſome ſin, ſtill have recourſe to Baptiſm, that thy Soul may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged therehence. For although Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37474:51"/> be but once adminiſtred, yet that once teſtifieth that all mans ſins paſt, preſent, or to come, are waſhed away, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. And never reſt, before thou haſt a feeling of that renewing power ſignified in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: namely, the power of Chriſt's death Mortifying ſin, and the virtue of His reſurrection, in the renewing of the Spirit.</p>

               <p>2. It is called the Table of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21.</p>

               <p>4. The Euchariſt, becauſe of the uſual Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>5. A Sacrifice: ſo it was called by the ancient Fathers, <hi>non <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> aut merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> not a propitiatory or meritorious Sacrifice, as the Papiſts would have it, but an Euchariſtical Sacrifice; becauſe it is a ſolemn commemoration and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the propitiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. At length it was called <hi>Miſſa,</hi> from the offerings ſent by the rich, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Poor; or from a diſmiſſion of the Congregation after the publick Ordinances: But we retaining the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation or name delivered in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, call it the Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>There are many deteſtable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable differences between the Lord's Supper, and the Popiſh Maſs, which I think not fit here to recite, as not at all for edification.</p>
               <p>I define the Lords Supper thus: The inſtituted and commanded diſtribution of Bread and Wine, by Chriſt Himſelf, in which Chriſt is certainly promiſed to me and all true believers. Or thus,</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:37474:52"/>
               <p>The Lord's Supper, is the diſtributing and taking of Bread and Wine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt to all true believers, that He might teſtifie by theſe tokens, that He gave His body to death for us, and ſhed His blood; and that He gave us theſe to eat and drink, to aſſure us that He will dwell in us, and nouriſh and quicken us to eternal life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He aſſures and ſeals, that He gave His body for us upon the Croſs, and that His blood was as truly ſhed for us, as we ſee with our eyes the bread to be broken for us, and the cup to be given to us. Next, that He by that His body Crucified, and by that His blood poured out, will as certainly nouriſh our Souls to eternal life, as ſurely as our bodies are fed by Bread and Wine, taken from the hand of the Miniſter, which are reached forth unto us as ſeals and pledges of the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Rites or Signs here, are the Bread broken and eaten, the Wine diſtributed and taken; or the breaking and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of the Bread, the diſtributing and drinking of the Wine.</p>
               <p>The things ſignified are, the body of Chriſt Crucified, and the blood of Chriſt poured out: the eating and drinking of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37474:53"/> them, ſignifie our union with Chriſt by faith, whereby we being made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Him and all His benefits, from Him (as branches from a Vine) do ſuck and draw eternal life, or nouriſhment to eternal life.</p>
               <p>Of this our union and communion with Chriſt we are certified,</p>
               <p>1. By the analogy or proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſign and the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>2. By the promiſe which is added to the ſign.</p>
               <p>The analogy chiefly propoſeth two things to us.</p>
               <p>1. The Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Our Communion with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bread is not only broken, but alſo is given to us to eat.</p>
               <p>Or more clearly thus: The Lord's Supper is the ſecond Sacrament of the New Teſtament, wherein by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements of Bread and Wine, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and exhibited by the Miniſter, and rightly received by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants aſſurance is given to thoſe that are ingra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed into Chriſt of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in Him, and receiving nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Him unto eternal life.</p>
               <p>In the ſame ſenſe it is alſo called the Lord's Table; thou doſt therefore come
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37474:53"/> to the banquet of Chriſt, to be His gueſt, as often as thou doſt eat and drink of this Supper.</p>
               <p>The Lord's Supper came in ſtead of the Paſſeover or Paſchal Lamb, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He appointed it a Supper unto us, but becauſe He ordained it in room of the Paſſeover.</p>
               <p>For in the ſame night wherein He was<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> betrayed, immediately after He had eaten the Paſſeover with His Diſciples, He did both Himſelf with them cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate<note place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. 26.</note> this Holy Sacrament, and withal gave charge for continuance of the ſame in the Church until His ſecond<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> coming.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Lord's Supper are two: 1. The earthly matter or the outward ſigns. 2. The action requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the uſe of the outward ſign.</p>
               <p>The outward ſign or earthly matter is again twofold: 1. The Bread. 2. The Wine.</p>
               <p>1. The Bread of the Lord, is Chriſt's body given to death for us; ſo Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my body which is given for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Cup of the Lord, is that New Covenant through His blood which was ſhed for us. By a Synechdoche the Cup
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37474:54"/> is put for the Wine contained in the Cup. Then by a Sacramental Metonymie, becauſe neither the Cup, nor the Wine in the Cup, is ſubſtantially that very new Covenant which was confirmed by Chriſt's blood ſhed for us: but it is the Sacrament of that Covenant, and that in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe it is an outward ſign call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our remembrance, and as it were repreſenting before our eyes, that New Covenant or Teſtament eſtabliſhed by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe it is a ſeal of our faith, ſealing up the certainty of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the continuance of it with us. So the Wine is a Sacrament of the blood of Chriſt, not contained in the veins, but ſhed out of His body upon the Croſs, or as it was ſhed for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins. So our Saviour ſaid, <hi>This</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>is My blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Alſo here by Bread and Wine is noted out unto us, that we do perfectly and wholly find in Chriſt, not meat alone, but drink alſo: that is, not only one cauſe or part of Salvation and eternal life, but whatſoever wholly is requiſite or neceſſary thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:37474:54"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the ends of the Lord's Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To confirm our faith, and to be a moſt ſure teſtification of our union and communion with Chriſt. For Chriſt by theſe ſigns teſtifies to us, that He by His body and blood, doth as truly nouriſh us to eternal life, as truly as we receive theſe ſigns out of the hand of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And this teſtification is directed to every particular perſon, that with true faith receives theſe ſigns or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols. And we ſo receive theſe elements out of the hand of the Miniſter, as if Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf did reach it forth with His own hand unto us.</p>
               <p>2. That it may be a publick profeſſion of our faith, and a ſolemn thankſgiving with an obliging our ſelves to perpetual thankfulneſs, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a celebration of this ſo great a benefit. And theſe are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt's words, <hi>This do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>of Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This commemoration is chiefly faith in the heart, joyned with a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>3. That it may be a publick diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or diſcerning mark, between the true Church of Chriſt, and all other Nations and Sects whatſoever. For the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37474:55"/> Lord inſtituted this for His Diſciples, and not for others.</p>
               <p>4. That it might be a bond of Love between all thoſe who lawfully take it, to become Members of one body, under one Head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>We being many are one bread and one body;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> Now the Members of the ſame body do mutually love each other.</p>
               <p>5. That it may be a bond of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings of the Church; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament is, that it be done in the publick Aſſembly or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Thence are thoſe words, <hi>When ye come together into one place; And</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>when ye come together to eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Or more briefly thus: The ends of the Lord's Supper are,</p>
               <p>1. To be a remembrance of Chriſt's Sacrifice performed on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>2. To be a ſign of the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. To be a Sacrament of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, continuance, and preſervation of them in the Church, which once by Baptiſm have been ingraffed into the Church of Chriſt. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by this Sacrament doth teach us, by the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37474:55"/> communion of His body and blood that our Souls are nouriſhed in hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
               <p>By the Bread Chriſt repreſent His body to us, and by the Wine his blood; to ſhew unto us, that as there is in Bread a nouriſhing faculty, to feed and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our bodies for this preſent life: So His body hath a nouriſhing and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power with it, ſpiritually to nouriſh our ſouls.</p>
               <p>In like manner alſo, as Wine exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and cheers the heart of him that drinks it, refreſheth his ſpirits, and maketh the whole body the more ſtrong: Even ſo Chriſts blood doth ſtrengthen our hearts, and fill them with joy and gladneſs. We do truly by faith feed on the body and blood of Chriſt, when we are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſwaded that we ſhall be ſaved by His obedience, righteouſneſs, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to His Father on our behalf, as the Father imputeth it unto us.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt neceſſarily have an intereſt in Chriſt; for we can never be partakers of His good benefits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs firſt He had given Himſelf unto us.</p>
               <p>By this Sacrament our communion with Chriſt is confirmed and ſealed.</p>
               <p>The Lord's Supper refers us to the

               <p>So alſo another abuſe of the Papiſts is, to deny the Cup to the people: whereas Chriſt in His inſtitution ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> It is a high Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious impiety, thus expreſly to go againſt Chriſt's inſtitution in His own words.</p>
               <p>It is by faith alone we eat the body, and drink the blood of Chriſt. And yet we ſay not that the body of Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Bread, and His blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Cup: but if we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the truth and reality of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt have our hearts lifted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37474:57"/> up heaven-wards, and look upwards; where Chriſt is in the glory of His Father, and from whence He ſhall come to be our Judge: for he that ſeeks Him corporally in theſe corruptible elements, manifeſtly errs.</p>
               <p>So for me to eat the body of Chriſt crucified for me, and to drink His blood ſhed for me, is not only firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the whole paſſion and death of Chriſt, and by it to obtain remiſſion of<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 35. to 54.</note> ſins and everlaſting life; but alſo by His Spirit which dwelleth in me, to be more and more united to His bleſſed body: as Chriſt there ſaid, <hi>He that eateth My</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 56.</note>

                     </gap>leſh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that although Chriſt is in Heaven, and we on Earth, yet we are fleſh of His fleſh, and bone of His bone.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30. &amp; 3. 16, 17. &amp; 4. 15, 16. Joh. 6. 57.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Even as all the members of the body are quickened and directed by one ſoul, ſo are we by one and the ſelf ſame S-pirit. So then our eating the body, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood of Chriſt, which is not corporally but ſpiritually done, ſignifies four things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Our believing of the paſſion and death of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Our receiving remiſſion of ſins

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:37474:58"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:37474:59"/> and everlaſting life by faith in Him.</item>
                  <item>3. Our union with Chriſt by His Holy Spirit which dwelleth both in Chriſt and us.</item>
                  <item>4. The benefit of quickening by the ſame Holy Spirit.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So to eat the body and drink the blood of Chriſt, is to believe that we through the merits of Chriſt, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by God into grace and favour; and by the ſame faith we receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and are reconciled unto God; and that the Son of God (that Word which was made fleſh) who hath<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 14.</note> united to Himſelf our humane nature (which He perſonally took) doth dwell in us, and hath joyned us to Himſelf and His aſſumed humane nature, by pouring upon us His Holy Spirit, by which He regenerates us, and reſtores light in us, righteouſneſs and eternal life, the ſame which ſhineth in His aſſumed humane nature.</p>
               <p>Or more briefly thus: to eat the body of Chriſt is,</p>
               <p>1. To believe in Him.</p>
               <p>2. By faith, to receive remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>3. To be united unto Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37474:59"/>
               <p>4. To be made partaker of the life of Chriſt, or to be conformable to Chriſt by His Holy Spirit, which worketh the ſame things both in Chriſt and in us.</p>
               <p>This our eating is our communion with Chriſt, which the Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and which in this Sacrament we do profeſs; namely our ſpiritual union with Chriſt, ſuch as is of the members with the head, and of the branches with the vine.</p>
               <p>This eating of His fleſh, Chriſt teacheth in <hi>John</hi> 6. and confirmeth it by theſe outward ſigns in the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>For in the Lord's Supper as we do eat the Bread, and drink the Wine, even ſo there as ſurely Chriſt gives to all true believers His body to eat, and His blood to drink.</p>
               <p>This is clearly manifeſted to us in the words of inſtitution, <hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25. And this promiſe is repeated by St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? For we being many are one bread, and one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37474:60"/> body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> To explain this briefly, It is called the cup of bleſſing, or of giving thanks, becauſe it is received to this end, that we ſhould give thanks to Chriſt for His death and paſſion for us: or that we ſhould uſe it ſo, as to put us in mind of Chriſt's benefits towards us, and for theſe to give Him thanks.</p>
               <p>Communion of the blood of Chriſt: Communion is a participation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing: the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt is by faith to be made partakers of Chriſt and all His benefits, the ſame Spirit being in us which is in Chriſt, and working the ſame thing in us which he doth in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is a ſpiritual communion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have with Chriſt, as members with the head, and as branches with the vine.</p>
               <p>For the Bread and Wine are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that is the ſign and teſtimony of our Communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Communion (as the Apoſtle there ſaid) conſiſteth in this, that we being many are one body.</p>
               <p>This makes againſt the corporal eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Papiſts in this Sacrament, for our communion with Chriſt is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37474:60"/> only by faith and by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the common head, His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are common, and communicated to all His members: Hence alſo it follows that the members are common among themſelves, whence ſhould flow mutual love and amity.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts to uphold their Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation do ſay, that we muſt take the words litterally, and ſo immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words of conſecration at the laſt ſyllable of the laſt word, that the Bread is tranſubſtantiated or changed into the very body of Chriſt, and the Wine into His blood.</p>
               <p>But this is a Sacramental ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>This is my body.</hi> As St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to that general rule about Sacramental actions, adds this inſtance of eating the body of Chriſt. This is a certain way (ſaid he) of finding out whether ſuch a phraſe or ſpeech be proper or figurative, that whatſoever in Divine Word or holy Scriptures, cannot be done by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good manners, nor be properly referred to the truth of our faith, we muſt know it to be a figurative ſpeech. And ſhortly after inſtances in that place, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 53.</note>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:37474:61"/> 
                  <hi>and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> Doth our Saviour here command ſuch a nefarious act, to have the Jews fall upon Him, kill and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ley Him, to eat His fleſh, and drink His blood? No; it is a figurative ſpeech, there Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to communicate with the paſſion and ſufferings of the Lord, and moſt ſweetly to lay it up in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that for us His body and fleſh was crucified and wounded.</p>
               <p>So alſo this is a figurative ſpeech, when our Saviour ſpeaks of the Bread, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and of the Cup, <hi>This is my blood.</hi> This Cup is the New Teſtament in My blood: where the name of the thing ſignified, by a Sacramental Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie is given to the ſign.</p>
               <p>So the words of Chriſt muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Sacramentally, the Bread is called the body of Chriſt, becauſe it is the ſign of the body of Chriſt: and the Cup, or the Wine in the Cup, is called the blood of Chriſt, becauſe it is the ſign of the blood of Chriſt. And the Cup is called the New Teſtament becauſe it is the ſign of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>So the true ſence and meaning of Chriſt's words, <hi>This is my body which is given for you,</hi> is thus, This Bread which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37474:61"/> is broken by Me and given to you, is a ſign of My body which is given to death for you, and is a certain ſign of your conjunction and union with Me: ſo that he that believeth and eateth this bread, he doth truly feed on My body.</p>
               <p>But according to that impious fiction of the Popiſh tranſubſtantiation, many abſurdities follow. As,</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt brake bread, not His body; therefore the bread is not really the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. The body of Chriſt is given for us, and not bread; therefore bread is not really the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt did not ſay, under theſe ſpecies is My body, or My body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under theſe ſpecies; therefore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts pervert Chriſt's words, and keep not to the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt ſaid not of bread, let this be made My body, but <hi>this is My body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Notwithſtanding their tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, the bread is neither anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, nor changed into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a body, but remaineth bread ſtill.</p>
               <p>6. In every Sacrament there are two things, the ſign and the thing ſignified:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37474:62"/> but tranſubſtantiation taketh away the ſign, namely Bread and Wine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth wholly overthrow the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>7. Tranſubſtantiation takes away the analogy between the ſign and the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>But no more of this; I will only add four Reaſons againſt the carnal or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Then the wicked receiver might eat and drink Chriſts body and blood, as well as the true believer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>There is another groſs error alſo of Conſubſtantiation:</p>
               <p>Conſubſtantiation is a coexiſtency of two ſubſtances in the ſame place: or the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37474:62"/> preſence of the body and blood of Chriſt, not under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, but under the very Bread and Wine. <hi>Luther</hi> was of this opinion, that it remained bread ſtill; but under, in, or with the bread is the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this is the common tenent and opinion of thoſe who this day are called <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this, theſe few reaſons may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>1. The whole action of the Lord's Supper is done in remembrance of Chriſt, what need have we of that, if Chriſt's body were really preſent, either under, with, or in the elements?</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt's body is in Heaven: and the <hi>Heavens muſt receive Him, until the times of reſtitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3. 21.</p>
               <p>3. This is an eſſential property of every magnitude (and therefore of Chriſt's body alſo) to be in one place, and circumſcribed or encompaſſed of one place.</p>
               <p>4. If Chriſt's body were eaten cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, then the wicked as well as the Godly partake of the fleſh of Chriſt: but to eat His fleſh is to believe in Him, and to have eternal life.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:37474:63"/>
               <p>5. It is abſurd to think that Chriſt ſitting with His diſciples, did with His own hands take His own body, and give it wholly to every one of His Diſciples.</p>
               <p>This is the Sacrament not of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of the glorious body of Chriſt, but of His ſuffering and crucified body.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is My body which is given for you:</hi> it is the Sacrament of Chriſt's body delivered unto death for us. And that theſe two ways.</p>
               <p>1. It is a viſible ſign, bringing to our remembrance, or repreſenting to us the body of Chriſt; that as with our bodily eyes we ſee the bread of the Lord ſo with the eyes of our Soul we may ſee Chriſt's body crucified for us.</p>
               <p>2. It is a ſeal, ſealing to our faith that Chriſt's body was certainly delivered to death for us, and is become the bread of life unto us.</p>
               <p>We muſt not therefore ſeek Chriſt's body in the earthly element, but by faith lift up our hearts to Heaven, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt aſcended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where He is. So in our Liturgy at the celebration of this Supper, we are admoniſhed to lift up our hearts.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:37474:63"/>
               <p>Now let us come to ſpeak of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions both of the Miniſter, and alſo of the Receivers.</p>
               <p>1. The actions of the Miniſter are theſe four.</p>
               <p>1. To take the Bread and Wine into his hands, and to ſeparate it from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bread and Wine. Which is to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to us, that God in His eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſeparated Chriſt to be our Mediator, and that He was ſet apart for this office: Him hath God the Father ſealed.</p>
               <p>2. To bleſs and conſecrate the Bread and Wine, by the Word and Prayer. Which ſignifies to us, that God in His due time ſent Chriſt into the world, and ſanctified Him, furniſhing Him with all gifts needful for a Mediator.</p>
               <p>3. To break the Bread and pour out the Wine. Which ſignifies, the paſſions and ſufferings of Chriſt, with all the torments which He endured both in ſoul and body for our ſins.</p>
               <p>4. To give and diſtribute the Bread and Wine to the receivers: which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that God gave Chriſt, and that Chriſt gave Himſelf to us: and that whole Chriſt and all His merits are freely offered to all ſorts of receivers. And that God hath given Chriſt to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37474:64"/> receivers to feed their ſouls unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 50, 51.</p>
               <p>2. Next we come to the Sacramental actions of the receivers, and they are theſe two.</p>
               <p>1. To take the Bread and Wine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Miniſter, every one into his or her hand. This ſignifies, his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and laying hold of Chriſt freely offered from God the Father, by the hand of faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Or, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt with all His benefits into his ſoul by faith.</p>
               <p>They, and they only have benefit by Chriſt crucified, which thus apply Chriſt to themſelves by a true and lively faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To as many as thus receive Him, <hi>to them gives He power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To eat the Bread, and drink the Wine, receiving them into the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and digeſting them. And this ſignifies our uniting to Chriſt, and enjoying of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> Him; or our application of Chriſt by faith, that the feeling of our true union and communion with Chriſt may be increaſed.</p>
               <p>We muſt with delight apply Chriſt and His merits, to all the neceſſities of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37474:64"/> our Souls; ſpiritually feeding upon Him, and growing by Him.</p>
               <p>For the eating of the Bread to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our nature, betokeneth the inward ſtrengthning of our ſouls by Grace, through the merit of breaking Chriſt's body for us. And the drinking of the Wine to cheriſh our bodies, betokens that the blood of Chriſt ſhed on the Croſs, and (as it were) drunk by faith, doth cheriſh our ſouls.</p>
               <p>And as God doth bleſs theſe outward elements to preſerve and ſtrengthen the body of the receiver; ſo Chriſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and received by faith, doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh him, and preſerve him both body<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 50, 51.</note> and ſoul unto eternal life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3. 11. 17, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are to be admitted to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. They who are of years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſound judgment, able to diſcern the Lord's body, ought to repair to it. If they are able to prove and examine themſelves, and rightly to remember the Lord's death. For ſo is the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>This do in remembrance of me:</hi> And <hi>let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup: for ſo ye ſhew the Lords
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37474:65"/> death till He come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>2. They who are baptized, and by Baptiſm made members of the Church. For our Covenant with God made in Baptiſm, is renewed in the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>As formerly none might eat of the Paſſeover unleſs he were circumciſed; ſo none may partake at the Lord's table unleſs baptized.</p>
               <p>3. Who in word and deed profeſs their faith and repentance; or who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the profeſſion of their faith and repentance, by the actions of their life. For of occult and hidden things the Church judgeth not: but ſhe admitteth all thoſe whom ſhe can judge to be members of Chriſt: that is, thoſe whom ſhe hears and ſees by their confeſſion and by their outward deeds to profeſs their faith and repentance; whether they be Godly, or whether they be Hypocrites not yet made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to be performed of every Chriſtian that he may partake worthily of the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three things.</p>
               <p>1. A due preparation before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
               <p>2. Great heed in the whole duty of receiving.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:37474:65"/>
               <p>3. A thankful cloſe and ſhutting up of it. Of all theſe in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the preparation requiſite to this holy Sacrament?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Duly to ſearch and examine their own ſouls, if they can find in themſelves thoſe things which God requires in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants.</p>
               <p>This preparation is twofold: 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. 2. Outward.</p>
               <p>1. Inward, which is ſpiritual, and that conſiſts in a man's examining of himſelf, and ſo to try his own worthineſs: There is a double worthineſs.</p>
               <p>1. A Worthineſs of the perſon; if thou haſt faith, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed by faith to thee.</p>
               <p>2. A worthineſs of the uſing; which is true reverence inward and outward; forgiveneſs, love, a ſerious bewailing of ſins, and repentance; the meditation of the benefits of Chriſt; the diſcerning the body of the Lord, thankſgiving; and the avoiding of all offences. All theſe things be particularly diſcuſſed by many worthy writers, and therefore I here wave them. Briefly thus,</p>
               <p>Such as will in a holy ſort prepare themſelves to celebrate the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, muſt have,</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:37474:66"/>
               <p>1. A knowledg of God, of Man's fall, and of the promiſed reſtauration into the Covenant by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. True faith in Chriſt: for every man receiveth ſo much as he believeth, Heb. 4. 2.</p>
               <p>3. True repentance of all their ſins paſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 6.</p>
               <p>4. Perfect love and charity: forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we would be forgiven: true repentance purgeth out malice among all other ſins; and a ſound faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, towards God, and towards our brethren alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 19. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 28, 29.) placeth preparation in theſe three acts. 1. Diſcerning the Lord's body. 2. Examining of our ſelves. 3. A worthy diſpoſition. To ſpeak a little of all theſe diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>1. Diſcerning the Lord's body; which conſiſts in a good underſtanding and judgment of the nature, uſe, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sacrament. Now becauſe theſe things cannot be underſtood but out of the fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion, about ſin, and miſery following thence; the Grace of Chriſt, and the bleſſings therehence ſlowing: of our duty in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37474:66"/> thankfulneſs and obedience to God; therefore the knowledg of the principal points of Chriſtian Religion which are neceſſary to Salvation, are needfully required to this diſcerning here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>2. Examining our ſelves; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a ſerious trial if we are ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that we may uſe this Sacrament with profit.</p>
               <p>The rule of this examination is the Word of God, eſpecially as it concerns the inſtitution of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Our diſpoſitions to be looked into in this trial of our ſelves, are our faith, repentance, charity, a deſire of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>3. A worthy diſpoſition; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an agreeableneſs of our affections with this ſacred buſineſs.</p>
               <p>And here is required,</p>
               <p>1. That we renew our repentance, as for all our former ſins, ſo eſpecially our late failings, and for thoſe ſins we are moſt inclined unto, and thoſe committed ſince our laſt receiving.</p>
               <p>2. To ſtir up in our ſelves a hungring and thirſting after Chriſt and His Grace, as for pardoning and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our ſins, ſo to be enabled
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37474:67"/> for better obedience, and newneſs of life.</p>
               <p>3. To ſtir up our faith to lay hold on the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>4. That with all humility, reverence, and devotion, we receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and of the promiſes of God.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the firſt part to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by every Chriſtian worthily to partake of the Lord's Supper, which is Preparation. Now for the ſecond, Heedfulneſs in the duty of receiving. And that conſiſts in theſe four things.</p>
               <p>1. Reverendly to attend, the better to apply the whole action; joyning with the Miniſter in his Prayers, making uſe of all the Sacramental actions both in the Miniſter, and alſo in the receivers, whereof we ſpake at large before, and ſo thankfully commemorating the Lord's death, for the comfort and refreſhing of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>2. According as it is commanded, all muſt take the Bread and Wine into their hands.</p>
               <p>3. According to Chriſt's command, to eat that Bread, and drink that Wine.</p>
               <p>4. They muſt uſe thankſgiving, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves both ſouls and bodies
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37474:67"/> is a Sacrifice of thankſgiving. In which<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> reſpect this Sacrament is properly called the Euchariſt. <hi>As oft as we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we ſhew the Lords death,</hi> &amp;c. The Ordinance it ſelf is full of death: what other language doth bread broken, and the blood ſevered from the body ſpeak, but a dying Chriſt? As the Ordinance, ſo the Communicant doth by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in fact declare his profeſſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to Chriſt, and embracing of the death of Chriſt for remiſſion of Sins, and reconciliation of his perſon unto God. Which although at all times we may and ſhould remember, yet God would have a ſolemn ſtanding Ordinance in His Church, for the commemoration and ſhewing of it forth; which Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is this of the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>This muſt be our actual exerciſe at the time of our eating and drinking at this Holy Table, to ſhew forth the Lord's death. The death of Chriſt then muſt fill our eyes, ears, lips, and thoughts; If any of us could ſee Chriſt dying, that ſight would take us up. Here we come as near to ſee Him dying, as can be repreſented unto us: Here Chriſt is Crucified before our eyes. Thus much<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:37474:68"/> for the ſecond part, which is a Chriſtian heedfulneſs in the act of receiving. Now of the third and laſt part, a thankful cloſe and ſhutting up this our duty in this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>1. By joyful thankſgiving, with Prayers.</p>
               <p>2. Meditation how we are bettered; what increaſe we find of our faith in Chriſt, love to God and all His Saints, what ſtrength and power we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt ſin, luſt, and corruption; what new obedience we ſhew forth in our lives; and what increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>This do in remembrance of me:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ſolemn Memorial inſtituted by Chriſt Himſelf. Great Deliverances or Mercies have ſolemn commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Such was the Paſſeover, and the Feaſt of Purim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Chriſt did not ordain it for His Nativity, Circumciſion, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though all theſe were for us and our Redemption) but in remembrance of His death: hereby we ſhew the Lord's death. Becauſe our ſins are done away
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37474:68"/> by His death; therein (in His death) was made the Sacrifice of atonement; Redemption and Reconciliation was made thereby, the Covenant confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the juſtice of God ſatisfied, and everlaſting life procured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Let us make this thankful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to and within our ſelves, what fruit and benefit we receive from Chriſt, and the torments and pains He endured for us both in His bleſſed body and ſoul; nay His Soul-pains were the ſole or chief of all His pains. Do not theſe deſerve a thankful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?</p>
               <p>2. We make this remembrance to others, to all the world, by our ſolemn profeſſion of Chriſt and His death, to which we ſtick, for remiſſion of ſins, and acceptation with God.</p>
               <p>3. We make this remembrance to God, that Chriſt by His death hath ſatisfied God's juſtice, and hath made peace through the blood of His Croſs. <hi>Who ſhall therefore lay any thing to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>charge of Gods elect? it is Chriſt that dyed for us,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 34.</p>
               <p>I cloſe up with the Allegory of the Paſchal Lamb and Chriſt, how the type and anti-type or the thing ſignified fitly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37474:69"/> anſwer and agree; in theſe thirteen things.</p>
               <p>1. It muſt be a lamb of the flock; ſo Chriſt was true man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>2. A Lamb without blemiſh; ſo Chriſt was without ſin.</p>
               <p>3. To be killed and roaſted with fire; to ſhew the bitter death and paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. A bone of it muſt not be broken; ſo Chriſt had not a bone broken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 36.</p>
               <p>5. It muſt be in the evening; ſo Chriſt ſuffered in the end of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. and 9. 26.</p>
               <p>6. The poſts were to be ſprinkled with the blood; ſo Chriſt's blood is ſprinkled on our Conſciences, and His ſatisfaction is imputed to us, <hi>Rom. 3. Iſai.</hi> 53. 6.</p>
               <p>7. Seeing the blood, the deſtroying Angel paſſed over, and they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from death; ſo Chriſt by his blood frees us from everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>8. The Lamb was to be eaten, and in every family; ſo Chriſt by faith is to be applyed by every believer.</p>
               <p>9. The Lamb was to be roaſted whole, his head, legs &amp; appurtenances; ſo whole Chriſt is to be received, and wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37474:69"/> to all the articles of our faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p>10. Without leaven: that is without hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>11. It muſt be eaten with bitter herbs: with true repentance and bitter grief for ſin which cauſed that bitter paſſion of Chriſt. He that will be Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt take up the Croſs.</p>
               <p>12. It muſt be eaten haſtily, and with their ſtaves in their hands, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of ſtrangers: to ſhew that we are Pilgrims here, and travailing to our heavenly countrey have need of ſuch a <hi>Viaticum</hi> in the way.</p>
               <p>13. Only Circumciſed to eat thereof. So only the regenerate feed on Chriſt by faith; and Chriſt is profitable only unto them.</p>

                  <head>Some Sentences.</head>
                  <p>1. Our Union and Communion with Chriſt doth not mingle the perſons, nor unite the ſubſtances; but it conſociates our affections, and confederates our wills.</p>
                  <p>2. This is to eat that bread, and drink that cup, to abide in Chriſt, and to have Chriſt abiding in thee. And hereby it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37474:70"/> follows, that he that abides not in Chriſt, nor Chriſt in him, doth not ſpiritually eat of this bread and drink of this cup; although carnally and viſibly he eateth of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. To believe in Chriſt is to eat that bread of life: He that believeth in Chriſt feedeth upon Him; and is inviſibly fatted by Him, becauſe he is inviſibly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                  <p>4. Believers only eat the bread the Lord; wicked men who are againſt Chriſt in their practiſes may eat the bread of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>5. All Glory to God, and Salvation to Men, is placed in the death and paſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Eccleſiaſtes 12. 13.</bibl>
                  <q>Fear God: <hi>The whole Verſe runs thus,</hi> Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His Commandments: for this is the whole duty of Man.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe meaning is thus, as if King <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily comprehended in this point, that man ſhould lead his life in the fear of God, and in holy obedience unto Him: So that after this life he may enjoy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bleſſedneſs and happineſs in Him.</p>
               <p>Now the fear of God is commanded in the firſt Commandment; the ſcope
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37474:71"/> and meaning of the firſt Commandment is thus; that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> one in Subſtance and three in Perſons, the Creator and Governour of all things, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of His people, is to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the only true God, in all the powers of our ſoul. And that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37. Prov. 23. 26. Deut. 5. 29. Prov. 4. 23. Mat. 12. 35.</note> and ſpiritual worſhip of the heart, (wherein God eſpecially delighteth, and which is the ground of the outward worſhip,) may be given to Him, and none other: and that ſincerely without hypocriſie, as in His ſight who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 10.</note> and knoweth the heart.</p>
               <p>For this word before Me, or before My face, noteth that inward entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and worſhip whereof God alone doth take notice. And thereby God ſheweth, that He condemneth as well the corrupt thoughts of mans heart concerning His Majeſty, as the wicked practiſe of the body; for our thoughts are before His face.</p>
               <p>The eaſieſt way of explaining or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Commandments, is by dividing the obedience due to every Commandment, into its proper virtues as parts; and then the vices contrary to thoſe virtues will eaſily appear.</p>
               <p>As there are theſe ſeven virtues or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37474:71"/> parts of obedience due to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. 1. The acknowledging of God. 2. Faith in God. 3. Hope. 4. Love of God. 5. Fear of God. 6. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 7. Patience.</p>
               <p>But here we are to ſpeak only of the fear of God. The true fear of God, is to acknowledge the extream anger of God againſt ſin, and His power to puniſh it; and to eſteem our diſpleaſing of God or offending Him, and conſequently an eſtrangedneſs from Him, as the greateſt evil: and therefore extreamly to hate and deteſt ſin; and to be ready rather to ſuffer any evil, than to offend in any thing.</p>
               <p>Or thus, The fear of God, is from acknowledging of His Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, and Right which He hath over all creatures, and out of ſubjection unto Him, not willing to offend Him.<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt fear thy God; I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is feared, as He is juſt and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to puniſh; in regard of the evil of puniſhment, which He can inflict. So we ſtand in ſuch a Godly fear, as not to do any thing, but that which maketh for God's glory: and yet this is not a ſervile fear (whereby one is afraid to be

               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:37474:73"/>
               <p>We ſhould be more afraid to diſpleaſe God than any other: and this fear of God ſhould be ſtronger to move us to do good, than the fear of man to move us to do evil.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold fear of God. 1. Filial. 2. Slaviſh.</p>
               <p>1. Filial, which is from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, and the anger of God againſt it, and from a ſerious grief for ſins committed, becauſe of offending God thereby, and in regard of calamities that we and others endure for ſin, and a fear of future ſins and puniſhments; with an ardent deſire of avoiding thoſe evils, through the acknowledging of God's mercy ſhewed to us in and through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is uſually called filial fear, becauſe it is ſuch a fear as dutiful Children have toward their Father, grieving for the anger and diſpleaſure of their father, and fearing leaſt they ſhould offend him again, and ſo be puniſhed for it; and yet are always perſwaded of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love and good-will towards them, and therefore love him, and through this love do grieve the more becauſe they have offended him. So we read of <hi>Peter,</hi> that when he had denyed his Maſter,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37474:74"/> 
                  <hi>he went forth, and wept bitterly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 75.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But ſervile and ſlaviſh fear, is ſuch as of Servants to their Maſters, to avoid puniſhment, without faith, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a deſire and ſtriving to amend: and is uſually joyned with deſpair, and a with-drawing from God, and fleeing away from Him.</p>
               <p>Filial and ſlaviſh fear differ in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. Filial fear proceedeth from our truſt and confidence in God, and love to Him. But ſervile fear ariſeth from a ſight of ſin, and ſins flying in the face, with the ſence of judgment, and of the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>2. Filial fear principally turneth away from ſin which diſpleaſes God, but not from God Himſelf. But ſervile fear is a fleeing from, and a hatred not of ſin, but of puniſhments and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and ſo at length with a fleeing from, and a hatred of God Himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. Filial fear is joyned with ſome aſſurance of ſalvation and everlaſting life, and ſo draws us nearer to God. But a ſervile fear is joyned with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of everlaſting damnation and caſting away from God, and ſo drives
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37474:74"/> farther from Him: which is ſo much the more in them, as their doubting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of the Grace and Mercy of God is more or leſs.</p>
               <p>This ſlaviſh fear is in the Devils and wicked men, and is the beginning of everlaſting death, which the wicked and ungodly do feel even in this life. So ſaid <hi>Cain</hi> to God, <hi>My puniſhment is</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are ſome things do oppoſe and reſiſt the fear of God, in defect; and ſome in exceſs.</p>
               <p>1. In exceſs, as ſervile fear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; of which we ſpoke ſomething before.</p>
               <p>2. In defect; as, 1. Prophaneneſs; 2. Carnal ſecurity; 3. Contempt of God; 4. An Idolatrous fear.</p>
               <p>The wicked are utterly devoyd of all fear and reverence of God; they have<note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:37474:75"/> no fear of God before their eyes: an idolatrous fear, is not that fear alone which is from idols; as the poor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Indians</hi> worſhip the Devil becauſe he ſhould not hurt them; but that fear alſo which is from men and from the world, when a man fears them more than he fears God.</p>
               <p>Some carnal ſecurity may be in the Godly, yet it is otherwiſe with them than in the wicked. It is ſo in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the fear of God is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt out of their heart; but the<note place="margin">1 King. 14. 9.</note> wicked like <hi>Jeroboam</hi> caſt God behind their back: So God complains of the<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 35.</note> Jews, they had forgotten Him, and caſt him behind their back: and that they had caſt away the Law; <hi>There is no fear</hi>

                  <hi>of God before their eyes.</hi> Like the unjuſt Judge, who neither feared God, nor regarded man. We may have cauſe to<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 2.</note> fear ſuch; as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins at <hi>Gerar, Becauſe I thought that</hi>

                  <hi>the fear of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wifes ſake.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> fled for fear of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many acceptations of fear in Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. It is taken for natural fear, which is a certain natural affection, whereby
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37474:75"/> men are ſtricken by reaſon of ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or hurtful evil, either true or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. So <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of his brother<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 11.</note> Eſau, <hi>I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the mothers with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> So the City of <hi>Jericho</hi> feared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> being on the<note place="margin">Joſh. 2. 9, 11. Mat. 14. 30. &amp; 28. 4.</note> Sea, when he ſaw the wind boyſterous, was afraid, and cryed out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This natural fear is in it ſelf neither good nor evil. It was in Chriſt Himſelf, as He was man. It becomes evil and ſinful<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7. Mark 14. 33.</note> when diſtruſt is mixed with it.</p>
               <p>2. There is a free voluntary fear and reverence, which inferiours ſhew to their ſuperiours, making them careful to obey, and loth to offend, and that for the Lord's ſake. <hi>Let the wiſe ſee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 33.</note>

               </p>
               <p>3. Fear ſometimes in Scripture is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the thing or danger feared: <hi>the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Job, and that which I was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 3. 25. Prov. 1. 27.</note>

               </p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:37474:76"/>
               <p>4. For the perſon which is feared. In this ſence God is called the fear of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> ſware by the fear of his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is, by God whom <hi>Iſaac</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 42, 53.</note> feared; a Metonymie.</p>
               <p>5. Fear in Scripture ſometime is taken for, an holy affection of the heart aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and making us loth to diſpleaſe God by ſin, in reſpect of His great goodneſs and mercies, and for a love we bear to righteouſneſs. <hi>There is mercy</hi>

                  <hi>with Thee, that Thou mayeſt be feared:</hi> This is a filial or child-like fear, ſpoken of before. The Godly are commanded<note place="margin">Job 1. 2. Acts 10. 2.</note> thus to fear, and are commended for it; ſo is <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that they feared God.</p>
               <p>6. For a terrour in the heart of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, fearing God as a Judge; being loth to offend Him by ſin in regard of His puniſhments, and not from any hatred of wickedneſs. Thus <hi>Felix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled<note place="margin">Acts 24. 25.</note> and feared. This is ſervile and ſlaviſh fear, ſpoken of alſo before.</p>
               <p>7. Fear is taken for the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord. In every nation he that feareth God, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13. Acts 10. 35. Prov. 1. 7. Pſal. 112. 1. &amp; 128. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of Him. Bleſſed is every one that feareth the Lord;</hi> where is a Synechdoche of the part for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37474:76"/> the whole. For where the fear of God is truly planted, there will follow the whole worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>8. To think upon dangerous things which breed fear. So <hi>thine heart ſhall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 33. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>meditate fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. For a great terrour, and fear from God; which was ſent on the hearts of the men of thoſe Cities of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that they <hi>purſued not after the ſons of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 35. 5.</note>

                  <hi>God was upon thoſe cities round about them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the ſeveral ſignifications, and acceptations of fear in Scripture: and alſo what the true fear of God is; which is, whereby we ſo fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence His holy Majeſty and His Word, that we take heed by all means, of offending ſo gracious a Father, not ſo much for fear of puniſhment, as out of true love to God.</p>
               <p>Several encouragements out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to fear God. 1. God wiſheth it, <hi>Oh that they would fear Me, that it may be</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37474:80"/> And yet the Saints never depart or fall away from that aſſured confidence they have conceived of the mercies of God, though they have a continual ſtrife with their own diſtruſtfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe aſſaults faith upholds the Godly, and is like to a Palm-tree, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to riſe up againſt all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, how great ſoever they may be.</p>
                  <p>He that ſtriving with his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reſorts to faith in his troubles, is already in a manner a Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>David</hi> checks his own heart, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? Why art thou thus diſquieted within me? hope thou in God; for I ſhall yet praiſe Him,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Saints may become even dumb with ſilence, as though their faith were utterly overthrown, yet they faint not, but proceed in the Battel, and by Faith and Prayer do ſtill encourage themſelves in God; who at length will come in with the ſaving ſtrength of His own right hand.<note place="margin">Pſal. 20. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is great difference between the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37474:80"/> fears of the Godly and of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The fear of the wicked ariſeth out of the evidences of the guilt of ſin: but the fear of the Godly from a tender apprehenſion of the greatneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, holineſs and Majeſty of God, and <hi>His</hi> moſt <hi>pure eyes which cannot endure</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Habb. 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>to behold iniquity</hi> but with indignation; and out of a deep ſence of their own vileneſs and unworthineſs to meddle with holy things. But yet this fear in the Saints never brings any diſlike or hatred of God, or any wilful diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againſt Him. For as the fear of the ſoul deters, ſo the neceſſity of the precept drives on to an endeavour of obedience and well-pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>Slaviſh fear forceth a man to do the duty ſome way or other, without any regard to the manner of doing of it. There is alſo another branch of a holy filial fear, when we thinking on the examples of God's vengeance ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on wicked men for their ſins, do take care not to fall into the ſame ſins, leſt we have the ſame puniſhments: and ſo crave aid and aſſiſtance of God againſt them, depending upon His Grace and aſſiſtance by His Spirit. For we are of the ſame fleſh and blood as they were,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37474:81"/> and bear about us a body of ſin. So ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>Theſe things were our</hi>

Neither be ye idolaters, as were ſome of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither murmur,</hi> as <hi>ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.

                  <p>Therefore let the fear of God be a reverence joyned with honour.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The wicked fear not diſpleaſing God, ſo that they may do it without puniſhment: but becauſe they do know God is armed with power to revenge, therefore they tremble and fear, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending His wrath and vengeance. But the Godly fear to diſpleaſe and offend
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37474:82"/> God, more than they fear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore they are the more careful, wary, and watchful.</p>
                  <p>The fear which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> there ſpeaks of, is ſlaviſh fear. There is no ſuch ſlaviſh fear in love; but perfect love caſteth out that fear: that is, our true, lively and ſincere love to God, carryeth it ſelf no longer towards God, with a ſimple fear of His terrible Majeſty and Judgments; but with a ſweet, humble, and reverend apprehenſion of His Grace and goodneſs, by which He hath made and declared Himſelf moſt amiable and lovely to the ſoul; whereby is begotten hope and confidence in Him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is a threefold operation of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe that are led by Him.</p>
                  <p>1. He is unto them a Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, working fear.</p>
                  <p>2. He is a Spirit of adoption, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, through the ſence of God's mercy: for He not only makes them the Sons of God, but intimates to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits God's love towards them, that they are His Sons.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:37474:82"/>
                  <p>3. He is a Spirit of interceſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> them to go with boldneſs to the throne of Grace, and call upon God as their Father. We are now to ſpeak only of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Godly uſually in the firſt act of Converſion, feel the Spirit caſting them down in the ſight of their ſins, rebuking them for ſin, and convincing them of ſin; letting them ſee the bondage and ſervitude under which they lye; that they are ſlaves of Sathan, and guilty of everlaſting damnation, which works in them great fear. As the proclaiming of the Law wrought in the Children of<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> great terrour and amazement: So <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt began at the Preaching of<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 10.</note> the Law: and the people asked him,<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 10.</note> what ſhall we do that we may be ſaved? And yet the Apoſtle here doth not compare the Godly under the Law, with the Godly under the Goſpel: but the Godly under the Goſpel with themſelves; their ſecond experience of the operation of the Spirit in them with the firſt. Whereas in the firſt operation He was a Spirit of bondage, now He is a Spirit of adoption. God is pleaſed to bring us by the gates of Hell to Heaven. Firſt deeply to humble us,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37474:83"/> then to exalt and comfort us. So then the meaning of theſe words (<hi>ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear</hi>) is thus, Albeit in the time of your firſt Converſion you were ſtricken with a fear of that wrath which is the recompence of ſin; yet now the Spirit of adoption hath not only releaſed you of that fear of damnation, which you conceived at the firſt, through the ſight and ſence of your ſins; but alſo hath aſſured you of Salvation, making you certain that God is become your Father in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>All the terrours and fears wherewith God humbles his children at the firſt, are but preparatives to his comforts and Conſolations, that they may be the more ſweet to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>15th</hi> verſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Two effects of the Spirit are oppoſed. For in ſome the Spirit worketh fear; in others, love and aſſurance, and firſt fear, then aſſurance. In all the elect which are of years of diſcretion, the Spirit worketh a ſlaviſh fear firſt, before the filial aſſurance; fear is the ſign of the Spirit of bondage, confidence and aſſurance in God as a Father, is the proper effect of the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Such as were never afraid, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſured. So none have the Spirit of adoption, but ſuch as have had the Spirit of bondage. <hi>Therefore Chriſt ſaid,</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. To reverence the Majeſty and Power of God; ſo as the chief reaſon of our fear is not any evil that may come to us, but the excellent perfection of God.</p>
                  <p>2. When we do moſt eſpecially fear the offending of God, and diſpleaſing Him.</p>
                  <p>3. When we are affected with fear and trembling by beholding the tokens of God's diſpleaſure. So <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>who knoweth the power of Thy wrath? according to Thy fear, ſo is Thy wrath.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Seriouſly to flee from all thoſe things which are evil in the eyes of God: <hi>A wiſe man feareth, and departeth from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 14: 16. &amp; 14. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>evil. By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If out of Conſcience towards God, we abſtain from thoſe ſins which are hidden from the eyes of men, and ſafe enough in regard of man. <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the deaf; nor put a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 19. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>before the blind; but ſhalt fear thy God; I am the Lord:</hi> Now the deaf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear, and the blind cannot ſee any injury when it is done unto them; but the fear of God ſhould deter from it.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:37474:84"/>
                  <p>So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though he had the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note> of his Miſtreſs, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſecrecy, yet the fear of God kept him from committing Adultery.</p>
                  <p>3. If we do not only abſtain from ſins, but alſo hate them, and that becauſe God hates them. <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>is to hate evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If we are very careful about this thing, that we depart not away from<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 21.</note> God. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have kept the laws of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>6. If we fear not men, or any other creature; ſo as to deter us from doing our duty. <hi>Job,</hi> when he would make a proteſtation of his uprightneſs, ſaid, <hi>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the</hi>

                  <q>My Soul wait thou only upon God: for my expectation is from Him.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>OH how good is it to wait upon God! they alone who have found the benefit of it, know how good it is.</p>
               <p>There be three eſpecial ingredients, to make up this duty of waiting upon God: 1. Faith. 2. Patience. 3. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
               <p>1. Faith; which is <hi>the ſubſtance of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Faith is the bottom of our waiting upon God. Faith diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us, on what grounds we may ſtand; as namely upon God's faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all-ſufficiency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> ſtill encourageth himſelf,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37474:88"/> (as twice in this Pſalm) to wait upon God.</p>
               <p>2. Patience; waiting implies delay; and delay without patience is inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart</hi>

                  <hi>ſick.</hi> Delay is a ſore ſickneſs, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is the only cure of it; without which, that ſickneſs will prove death.</p>
               <p>3. Diligence and activity; he that waiteth for a mercy, muſt ſerve God's Providence in the uſe of all the means, which God hath ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the accompliſhment thereof. It is Diligence as well as Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that muſt inherit the promiſes. <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſurance of hope unto the end: that ye be not</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I will wait upon the Lord, I will not go back from Him; I will try or uſe no unlawful means, but will wait in His<note place="margin">Iſai. 26. 8.</note> way, and expect His help and aid, and the fulfilling of His promiſes; depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly upon Him and His Word.</p>
               <p>Faith apprehends the promiſe, and thereby brings forth Hope; and Faith by means of Hope, makes them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to wait.</p>
               <p>God is not like to man: but in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He promiſeth, He approveth Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt faithful, both in His ability and performances. I will therefore truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay<note place="margin">Iſai. 50. 10.</note> my ſelf upon Him my God.</p>
               <p>This waiting upon God is a virtue,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> whereby we are inclined to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe things, which God hath promiſed to us. <hi>If we hope for that we</hi>

               <p>1. To ſpeak of Repentance.</p>
               <p>We muſt know our ſins, feel the weight of them, be truly ſenſible of them, and that we are no way able to help our ſelves; elſe we will never come to Chriſt, and never ſeek out for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;

Now there is a legal<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> repentance, which is a grief of mind, through the ſence of God's wrath threatned againſt ſin, without any true hatred of ſin. There is alſo, ſecondly, an Evangelical repentance, which is a through change of a ſinner, in mind, will, and actions, from evil to good. The former of theſe was in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who put on ſack-cloth and went ſoftly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings 21. 26.</note> when he heard the evil threatned againſt him and his houſe; and this may be in wicked men, through fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of hell; not for their ſins againſt God: ſo upon the next tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they run into ſin again. But Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical repentance, which is becauſe we have broken God's Laws, and offended
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37474:102"/> ſo gracious a Majeſty; this it makes us more watchful over our ways, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and careful to pleaſe God, more<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 15. Gen. 17. 1.

But behold the good effects of a ſerious Evangelical repentance; <hi>The ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort, what ſorrow it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement deſire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge.</hi> I know that ſome do take the former part of this ſentence meerly in a literal ſence, <hi>Wordly ſorrow cauſeth death;</hi> that is, ſorrow or grief for outward croſſes and loſſes cauſeth ſuch anguiſh of mind, ſo affecting the body, that brings ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,

               <p>Daily let us renew our repentance, as we ſin every day. <hi>A juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again,</hi> that is, many times, a certain number for an uncertain: Even as a candle newly blowen out, and yet ſmoaking, is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and revived by a little breath; So a Soul is delivered from ordinary dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſtreights, by a timely (<hi>viz.</hi>) a dayly repentance. A member out of joint muſt be ſet as ſoon as may be; elſe a callous ſubſtance may grow in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37474:104"/> Cavity, and hinder the placing of it in again; So unleſs we renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance daily, a callous hardneſs may grow on our hearts, and hinder our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing again by repentance. Thus far of the firſt ſtep of our recovery out of a natural condition, into a ſtate of Life and Salvation; for God will bring us as by the gates of Hell unto Heaven; firſt He will bring us low, before He will raiſe us up. A child is about four weeks in the dark cell of the womb, and thence it comes out through difficulties and pains, which makes it cry when it comes into the World: Even ſo a child of God is held ſometimes in the dark, to make him ſee his miſery in a natural loſt condition; and then with pain and grief through the mortification of ſin, He comes into newneſs of life, to be born again by the Word and Spirit, and ſo is made the child of God. <hi>Except a</hi>

               <p>2. Perfect and conſummate, which is in Heaven; where alone perfection is to had.</p>
               <p>The parts of Sanctification are two, Mortification: Vivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>1. Mortification, or dying to ſin; and thereby we have a freedom from the dominion of ſin by the death of Chriſt. <hi>Ye are dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mortifie therefore your</hi>

               </p>

               <p>2. A daily renewing of repentance; as we daily do ſin.</p>

               <p>1. Incommunicable, as theſe, 1. His works of Merit, and Mediation: and 2. His work of government and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the Church; His giving of the Spirit; Quickning of His Word; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of His Enemies; Gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of His members; all theſe are perſonal honours which belong to Him as He is the Head of the Church.</p>

               <p>2. His communicable works, which are imitable by us, and which we ought to follow; ſo our Sanctification conſiſts in a conformity to the ways of Chriſt's ordinary obedience. So we read, <hi>that Chriſt went about doing good: No guile</hi>

The more we follow Chriſt, the nearer ſtill we come unto Him.</p>
               <p>Let us deny our ſelves, our natural ſelf, and our ſinful ſelf; and Chriſt will be all in all unto us.</p>

For as a ſervant that is continually beaten, ſhall not be without a blew-mark; ſo he that ſweareth and nameth God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſhall not be faultleſs. A man that uſeth much ſwearing ſhall be filled with iniquity; and the plague ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

               </p>
               <p>There is none that frequently ſwears, but ſometimes he forſwears or perjureth himſelf: like-as he who uſeth his mouth to multitude of words, ſometimes muſt needs ſpeak unfit things. Therefore ſaid the wiſe man, <hi>In the multitude of words</hi>

               <p>But ſome will think to ſay, O Lord, O God, O Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their common talk; or in a wondering way, good God! good Lord! is no ſin. Know aſſuredly, that ſuch fooliſh admirations, and taking of God's Holy name lightly into our mouths on every ſlight occaſion, is utterly condemned in the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. So the Reverend Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and many other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Divines do firmly conclude.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a ſuperſtitious and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous oath, to ſwear by an idol; or by Gods Creatures, as by the Maſs, our<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 5.</note> Lady, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by bread, fiſh, ſalt, fire,<note place="margin">Amos 8. 14.</note> light, and many ſuch-like fond traſhes.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37474:127"/> Whereas God never made or appointed His creatures for ſuch uſes.</p>
               <p>Others will plight their faith and troth to every trivial thing; which is an evident ſign that they have little faith or truth in them, or know not the true worth and value of them; elſe they would not ſo lightly lay ſuch precious Jewels to pawn upon every ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Let all ſuch, and every one alſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our bleſſed Saviour's rule afore-mentioned, in all their ordinary ſpeeches and communications, <hi>Swear not at all, but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, for whatſoever is more, cometh of evil.</hi> But of this, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more anon.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeak what an oath is, the parts of an oath, how an oath may be lawfully taken, and other things.</p>
               <p>An oath is, the craving of God's te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to confirm the truth of our teſtimony.</p>
               <p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Deſervedly is the teſtimony or witneſs-bearing of God, called to confirm a truth: for He is the truth,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37474:128"/> who neither can deceive nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>About an oath conſider two things:</p>
               <p>1. How an oath is to be taken?</p>
               <p>2. How it is to be performed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. How to be taken?</p>
               <p>In taking of an oath, four circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are to be conſidered. 1. The parts of an oath. 2. The form of an oath. 3. The end of an oath. 4. The divers ſorts or kinds of an oath.</p>
               <p>1. The parts of an oath, and they are four,</p>
               <p>1. Confirmation of a truth.</p>
               <p>2. Invocation of God alone, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a truth; and a revenger of a lye.</p>
               <p>3. Confeſſion, that God is a reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjury, when He is brought in as a falſe witneſs.</p>
               <p>4. A binding over unto puniſhment, if we uſe deceit.</p>
               <p>2. The form of an oath: we muſt ſwear,</p>
               <p>1. In truth, leſt we forſwear.</p>
               <p>2. In righteouſneſs, leſt we ſwear to that which is wicked.</p>
               <p>3. In judgment, leſt we ſwear raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or for a trifle.</p>
               <p>So we muſt ſwear truly, adviſedly, and rightly. As it is commanded, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth, in truth and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:37474:128"/> 
                  <hi>in righteouſneſs and in judgment.</hi> They who do not thus are reproved, <hi>which ſwear by the name of the Lord, and make</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 48. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in truth, nor in righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The end of an oath, which is, to confirm ſome neceſſary truth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; either for the ending of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, or for the performing of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. So an oath for confirmation, is among men an end of all ſtrife.</p>
               <p>4. The divers ſorts or kinds of an oath: 1. Publick. 2. Private.</p>
               <p>1. Publick, when the Magiſtrate doth upon juſt cauſe exact a teſtimony under the reverence of an oath.</p>
               <p>2. Private, which two or more take privately. As <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 53. <hi>Bodz</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Ruth 3. 13. and <hi>Obadiah</hi> to <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 12.</p>
               <p>So alſo there is an aſſertory oath, and a promiſſory oath.</p>
               <p>1. An aſſertory oath, or a confirming oath, which is to confirm the truth of a thing either paſt or preſent.</p>
               <p>2. A promiſſory oath, which is about a thing to come.</p>
               <p>So we ſee that an oath is, the calling of the name of God (the ſearcher of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:37474:129"/> the heart) to witneſs a needful truth, for the ending of ſtrife and controverſies. In a lawful oath, lawfully taken, there is a worſhipping of the name of God. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> would cauſe <hi>Achan</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth, he ſaith to him, <hi>My Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 7. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>give glory to the God of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. meaning thereby, that God is highly diſhonoured, if a man ſwear falſly by Him. For he doth in a manner, as much as lies in him, prophane and pollute God's holy name with a lye: and on the contrary, if a man ſwears truly, he honours God. Falſe ſwearing is called prophaning the name of God. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſwear by My name falſly; neither</hi>

                  <hi>ſhalt thou prophane the name of the Lord thy God: I am the Lord.</hi> This manner of <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s ſpeech was uſed among the <hi>Jems,</hi> ſo often as any was called to take an oath; as it appears by the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the Phariſees uſed to the blind man whom Chriſt had reſtored to ſight, they ſaid to him, <hi>Give God the</hi>

               <p>All which do prove, that we cannot call God to witneſs of our ſayings, but that we call Him to take witneſs of our perjury, if we ſpeak falſly or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>The name of God is made vile and common, when it is uſed in ſuperfluous ſpeeches, as in fooliſh admirations, which is a manifeſt taking of God's name in vain.</p>
               <p>Swearing was ſuffered and ordained, not for luſt or pleaſure, but for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſake. And there can be no neceſſity pretended, but where it is to ſerve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion or charity.</p>
               <p>But now it is ſo licentiouſly and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily uſed, that men think it no ſin at all.</p>

               <p>2. Becauſe it concerns the honour of God, and love to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe we have laudable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of oaths taken even in the New Teſtament. Chriſt Himſelf very often

An oath is therefore ordained of God, that it ſhould be a bond of truth among men, and a teſtimony that God is the authour and defender of truth.

               <p>5. The Prophets deſcribing the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the times of the New Teſtament, call an oath by the name of God: <hi>He that ſweareth in the earth,</hi>

               <p>And by all theſe reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſee clearly, that whereas our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c. and<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 34.</note> Saint <hi>James, Above all things ſwear</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Thoſe only are lawful oaths, which are not contrariant to the Word of God; and which are taken about things true, certainly known, lawful, in our own power to perform, weighty matters, neceſſary, profitable, and worthy things. And oaths taken about any things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to either of theſe, are unlawful: as of falſe things, and not certainly known, unlawful, not in our power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> An oath rightly taken, about law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, true, certain, weighty, and in our power are neceſſarily to be kept: But oaths about unlawful things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through error, or through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and againſt Conſcience, ſuch oaths are not to be kept; but we are to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them. For he that keeps an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful oath twice ſinneth; as, 1. By ſwearing evilly. 2. By obſerving that which he hath wickedly ſworn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whether extorted or enforced oaths are to be kept?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are to be kept, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing unlawful; and if they have thoſe conditions formerly ſet down, as true, known, lawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although thoſe oaths be unprofitable and hurtful to our ſelves. But if any oaths be extorted or drawn from us, through fear, and weakneſs, and againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they do not oblige, but are to be retracted. For what is wicked to be done, is wicked alſo to be ſworn; and we muſt not add ſin to ſin.</p>
               <p>But extorted oaths if they be not wicked and impious, about lawful things, and things in our own power, although difficult and hurtful to us; yet
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37474:134"/> are to be obſerved. For that which is lawful to do, is lawful to ſwear; and that which is lawful to ſwear, is lawful to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But God is ſaid in Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, for to ſwear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God frequently addeth an oath to His promiſes, but ſeldom to His threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; which ſhould make us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the great good-will of God to men, and His bearing with our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He knows our incredulity and aptneſs to doubt of His promiſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we are under afflictions and temptations. Therefore He vouchſafeth ſo far to condeſcend to our infirmities, that He joyns the ſanctity of an oath to confirm and ſtrengthen us. <hi>Wherein God</hi>

                  </gap>erve him that ſpeaks the truth; and to puniſh him that falſifyeth it; how can an oath fall on God, becauſe there is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37474:135"/> none that He can wiſh to be puniſhed by, if He deceives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That deſinition of an oath agreeth with the creature, and not with the Creator. That it may agree with both the Creator and the creature, we muſt define an oath more largely; namely an obliging of himſelf to puniſhment, if wittingly he doth deceive. To ſwear therefore by another, is to acknowledge and ſet him as the knower and revenger of perjury, and to oblige himſelf, to bear puniſhment inflicted by him; that is, to the loſs of ſoul or body, or life, or goods, or honour, if he doth not ſo intend and mean as he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>And therefore they that ſweat by creatures, commit idolatry.</p>
               <p>Men can oblige themſelves to bear puniſhment from men, if they keep not their promiſe: but to ſwear by any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by God, cannot be without Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and Sacriledge to the honour of God. For they make him by whom they ſwear, the knower of their hearts, a witneſs of their mind and will, and a judge and revenger of perjury.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Men truly ſwear</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>by the greater, and an oath</hi> given <hi>for confirmation is to them an end of all
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37474:135"/> ſtrife:</hi> but when God made promiſe to <hi>Abraham, becauſe He could ſwear by none greater, He ſware by Himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Men have a higher and greater than they, who can bring them to puniſhment whether they will or no: however they may deceive men, and either by force or fraud eſcape their judgment.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the truth can be found out no way elſe, then we have recourſe to an oath. Becauſe men judge by natural conſent, that he that takes an oath is not ſo prophane and wicked a wretch, of ſuch deſperate audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impudency, and ſo prodigal of his own Salvation, that of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he would provoke God to puniſh and plague him: or to think if he lies, that he ſhall eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>But God hath none greater than Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that is conſcious to, or a witneſs<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11. Job 9. 12.</note> of His ſecret will, or able to puniſh Him if He ſaith or thinketh otherwiſe. Therefore God ſwears by Himſelf; that is, He obliges Himſelf, and gives Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this Law, that if He deceives, and is not found to do, that is, not ſeriouſly to will what He ſaith He willeth, let Him then be accounted and declared by all His creatures to be vain, a lier, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37474:136"/> weak, or unjuſt, which is, not to be God. But there is an unutterable zeal in God of His glory, for which He created all things.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee as the wonderful great and inexpreſſible compaſſion of God towards men, in reſpect of our weakneſs and diffidence, to confirm His Divine truth and promiſes to us by an oath; and what a horrid wickedneſs it is, not to believe God when He ſwears to us. For God by His oath, layes His glory as it were to pawn unto us, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Himſelf voluntarily to ſuffer the loſs of His glory, if he doth not perform His promiſes.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſame ſence, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16.

                  <hi>hardened Pharaohs heart;</hi> if God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart, how did he do it himſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God worketh two ways in the hearts of wicked men.</p>
               <p>1. By with-holding His Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be moved unto good; as when light is taken away, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing but darkneſs and blindneſs; when God's Spirit is taken away, then mens hearts become hard as ſtones; when God's direction ceaſeth, then mens hearts are turned aſide into crookedneſs and perverſeneſs: ſo it is ſaid, that God doth blind, harden, and bow them, from whom He takes away the power to ſee and to do that which is right.</p>
               <p>2. By uſing the Miniſtery of Sathan, to ſtir up, frame, and incline their wills. God for the executing of His judgments by Sathan the Miniſter of His wrath, both appointeth the purpoſes of wicked men to what end it pleaſeth Him; and ſtirreth up their wills, and ſtrengthneth their endeavours.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon</hi> (as we ſaid<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 30.</note> before) did not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſs by him,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37474:146"/> becauſe the Lord hardened his ſpirit, and made his heart obſtinate, that He might deliver him into the hand of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Therefore becauſe it was God's Will to have him deſtroyed, the making of his heart hard and obſtinate, was God's preparing him for his deſtruction. So God hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart; that is, not only in not ſuſtaining it, but alſo in committing his heart to Sathan to be confirmed with obſtinacy.</p>
               <p>So <hi>God turned their hearts to hate His</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>people,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>it was the Lord that hardened the heart of Pharaoh and his ſervants to purſue after Iſrael, that He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>might be honoured upon Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>God hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, not that He did ſet and imprint hardneſs in his heart; but becauſe by ſundry actions He ordered and governed His wicked will. And they are four:</p>
               <p>1. God permitted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to walk after his own will.</p>
               <p>2. He left him to the malice of the Devil, and the luſts of his own heart.</p>
               <p>3. He urgeth him with a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to let the people go: and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> the more he is urged, the ſtiffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and more ſtubborn he is, and the more he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>els againſt God.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:37474:146"/>
               <p>4. God uſeth the hardneſs of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s heart, to the manifeſtation of His own juſtice and judgment: and ſo opened to him a way, that he might run head-long to his own utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>So God confounds his implacable enemies two ways here.</p>
               <p>1. By hardneſs of heart; which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (as we ſaid before) when God with-draweth His Grace from a man, and leaveth him to himſelf; ſo as he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on from ſin to ſin, and never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the laſt gaſp. And we muſt eſteem of it as a moſt fearful and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment of God: for when the heart is poſſeſſed therewith, it becomes ſo flinty and rebellious, that a man will never relent or turn to God. This was manifeſt in <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> for though God ſent moſt grievous plagues upon him, and all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet would he not ſubmit, or humble himſelf, ſave only for a fit, while the hand of God was ſo heavy upon him; for when the hand of God was removed, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his former obſtinacy, wherein he perſiſted until he was drowned in the red Sea. And this judgment of God, (of hardneſs of heart) is the more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:37474:147"/> becauſe when a man is in the midſt of all miſery, he feels no miſery.</p>
               <p>2. God confounds His enemies, as by hardneſs of heart, ſo by final deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſay final; becauſe all kind of deſperation is not evil; for a man may deſpair of himſelf, and of his own power in the matter of Salvation, which tends to his everlaſting comfort. But final deſperation is, when a man utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs of the pardon of his ſins, and of everlaſting life. Examples we have in <hi>Saul</hi> that ſlew himſelf, in <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> that hanged themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſin of deſperation is cauſed thus; ſo many ſins as thou committeſt without repentance, ſo many wounds thou giveſt to thine own ſoul: and in life or death God will make thee to feel the ſmart of it, and the weight of them all; whereby the ſoul ſinks down to the gulph of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, without recovery.</p>
               <p>The ſins which thou committeſt, lye at the door of thy heart, though thou feel them not; (as God ſaid unto <hi>Cain</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſin lyeth at the door</hi>) and if thou doſt not prevent them, by ſpeedy, and timely repentance, God will make thee to feel them once before thou dyeſt, and raiſe up ſuch terrours in thy Conſcience, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:37474:147"/> thou ſhalt think thy ſelf to be in Hell before thou art there.</p>
               <p>They that were ſent from the chief Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to apprehend Chriſt, though He had acknowledged, I am He; and they were aſtoniſhed and fell to the ground, and He had miraculouſly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Joh. 18. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Malchus</hi> his ear; yet for all, though they had ſeen his wonderful power, both in word and deed; they proceed in malice againſt Him, and bind Him as a Malefactor. In this we note, what a fearful ſin hardneſs of heart is. The danger whereof appears in this, that if a man be poſſeſſed with it, there is nothing that can ſtay or daunt him in his wicked proceedings, no, not the powerful words and deeds of our Saviour Himſelf. And indeed among all God's judgments there is none more fearful than this of hardneſs of heart; and yet how rife is it among us even in theſe our days? For it is very evident, that the more men are taught the Doctrine of Gods Law and Goſpel, the more hard and ſenſeleſs are their hearts: like unto an anvil, the more it is beaten upon with the iron hammer, the harder it is. So that that denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 28. 26, 27. is fulfilled in them. It is ſuch a terrible
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37474:148"/> judgment of God, into which when a man is fallen, he feels neither pain nor grief. Therefore we have cauſe with fear and trembling to look into it, leſt it take ſuch hold of us, that we be paſt all hopes of recovery. Sin is a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing; and cuſtom in ſin brings hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; therefore read that <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. Let us bewail and be humbled for our hardneſs of heart, whereby we are hindered from knowing and acknowledging God aright, and from diſcerning His glory and Majeſty; from acknowledging God's judgments, or our own ſins; dreaming we are ſafe from God's vengeance, and ſuch perils and miſeries which ariſe from ſin: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all thoſe out of Chriſt, and in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, have nothing ſtands between them and vengeance.</p>

               <p>HEre we have the Commandment of God, for the ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath-day. No one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo often iterated, or ſo much preſſed. This Commandment requireth at the hand of every man, one day of ſeven in every week, to be ſet a-part unto a holy reſt: and requireth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſeparate themſelves from their ordinary labour, and all other exerciſes, to God's Service alone, on that day: that ſo being ſevered from their worldly buſineſſes, and all the works of their Labours and Callings concerning this<note place="margin">Nehem. 13. 15. 22.</note> life, they may wholly attend to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:37474:149"/> Worſhip of God alone; wholly to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves to the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; that they may with more freedom of Spirit, perform the ſame.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> in his perfection, had need of this holy day, (as it was firſt enjoyned in the ſtate of innocency) much more<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</note> have we. To teach man from time to time, on the Sabbath-day to withdraw himſelf from the cares and labours of this life, to apply himſelf in freedom and tranquillity of mind, to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and actions of a ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſome will ſay, this fourth Commandment is ceremonial, and ſo it is taken away by the death of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer, No; but it is conſtantly and perpetually to be obſerved,</p>
               <p>1. For it is placed in the number of the ten Commandments, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, otherwiſe the Moral Law ſhould conſiſt but of nine, which is contrary to God's Word; <hi>And He declared unto</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe this fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (among the reſt, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of them, as a Diamond in a ring) was <hi>written by the finger of God;</hi> whereas<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 18.</note> no part of the ceremonial Law was.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:37474:150"/>
               <p>3. It was written in tables of ſtone, to ſignifie the perpetuity of it.</p>
               <p>4. It was before any ceremony of the Law, yea before Chriſt promiſed; for it was inſtituted in Paradiſe.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. The ceremonies were as a partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but God extends this Commandment, not only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Herein, I ſay, the Moral Law (which is the ten Commandments) is prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent above the ceremonial or judicial Law;</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the Moral Law is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the other Laws, and they are reducible to it.</p>
               <p>2. The Moral Law was to abide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but not the ceremonial nor judicial.</p>
               <p>3. This was immediately written by God, and commanded to be kept in the Ark, which the others were not. The ceremonial Law was to continue but until Chriſt came. The judicial Law<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note> was for the <hi>Jews</hi> political eſtate for the time being. But of the Moral Law it is ſpoken, <hi>The Lord came from Sinai, with</hi>

                  <hi>ten thouſand of His Saints, from his right hand went a fiery law for them.</hi> The
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37474:150"/> Service and Miniſtery of the Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in promulgating of the Law, makes much to the honour of the Law; for we never read of a Law enacted by ſo ſolemn, ſacred, and auguſt a Senate, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law was; where Jeſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with thouſands of Angels was the Speaker, and gave theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.<note place="margin">Acts 7. 53.

The Sabbath hath its morality and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity from the meer poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God.

So there are two parts of this: 1. Reſt from labour.<note place="margin">Parts of it.</note> 2. Sanctification of this Reſt. To ſanctifie the Sabbath, is not to make it holy (ſo it is already by God's inſtitution) but to ſeparate it from prophane uſes, and to devote it to the Worſhip of God. We muſt omit upon this day, the works of our outward temporal Vocation, which
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37474:151"/> muſt be done in the ſix dayes of the week. But the proper works of the Sabbath are theſe three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. Works of Neceſſity which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for our bodily ſuſtentation.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37474:152"/> from the Sabbath,</hi> that is, from ſpurning at it; and this is Paraphraſed, by <hi>not doing our own ways, nor finding our own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking our own words.</hi> Herein is the negative Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Sabbath. Affirmatively it conſiſts, as the ſame Prophet farther goes on,</p>
               <p>1. In <hi>calling the Sabbath our delight:</hi> that is, in a real account of it to be ſuch, and uſing it as ſuch; both in deſiring it before it comes, and rejoycing in it when it is come, as a good and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day.</p>
               <p>2. In calling it <hi>the holy of the Lord;</hi> that is, by faith to apprehend it to be of His holy inſtitution, and ſo ſet it apart from all other worldly time, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</p>
               <p>3. In calling it <hi>honourable,</hi> or a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day, a portion of time honoured with the name of God ſtamped upon it, as the day of days, and ſo accounting and uſing of it.</p>
               <p>4. In honouring <hi>Jehovah</hi> herein, by declaring His holineſs and goodneſs in His Sabbath, ſetting forth His praiſe from morning to night. The due ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Sabbath is hedged about with many great and precious promiſes,

They who abhor Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-performing in duty, drive the Lord from promiſe-performing in mercy: bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs will be to them in the latter end. I have obſerved, that a ſerious ſtrict and conſcientious obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is the outward greateſt character of an upright and gracious perſon. The 92 Pſalm (entituled <hi>a Pſalm for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day</hi>) declareth, that it is a good thing to begin the day with Praiſes to God <hi>early in the morning;</hi> and continue the ſame until it be night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Some will ſay, this ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath, belonged only to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, but as the moſt Reverend Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Biſhop <hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> But the day is altered; The <hi>Jews</hi> did and do obſerve <hi>Saturday,</hi> becauſe upon that day God reſted from the work
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:37474:153"/> of Creation; which now is changed into the firſt day of the week?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This was done, not by humane but by Divine authority: which appears by the practice of Chriſt and the Apoſtles:<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So this day is ſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Lords ſervice, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the dayes of the week are the Lords dayes, and he is to be ſerved and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:37474:153"/> worſhipped in them; but on this day wholly, and more eſpecially. For Chriſt alone could change the ſabbath day, who is <hi>the Lord of the Sabbath.</hi>

               <p>There are many more arguments for the change of the Sabbath, which we read of; but I ſpare prolixity. As God reſted from the works of Creation, then he ſanctified and bleſſed the ſeventh day on which He reſted; ſo it was meet that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt having finiſhed the work of our Redemption on the Croſs, when He ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 30.</note> bowed His head, and gave up the ghoſt; and reſted in the grave, and was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the Son of God with power,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> by His reſurrection from the dead: this ſame day in which Chriſt reſted from His labour, and the work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which was greater than the work of Creation) this day did He ſanctifie unto Himſelf.

               <p>The word <hi>Remember,</hi> is prefixed to this fourth Commandment, to ſhew that although all the Commandments are needful diligently to be obſerved and remembred; yet this more eſpecially. The word (Remember) is to put us in mind, 1. Of our natural forgetfulneſs of this Commandment. 2. Of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and worth of it. 3. To prepare our ſelves for the due keeping of it. For we are naturally moſt negligent in it, ſuffering our ſelves to be with-drawn by our worldly buſineſſes from the Lords Service upon the Lords day; and therefore ſuch a ſpecial warning is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be added: And as to keep it holy when it is come; ſo alſo to prepare our ſelves for it, and put our hearts, our ſelves, in a ready Sabbath-days poſture; and to diſpoſe our worldly buſineſſes ſo, that if poſſible we may have no avocation, lett, or hinderance on the Lords day.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak a little more of the words read at firſt, in <hi>Exodus</hi> 31. 13, &amp;c. for this word <hi>Verily,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it, ſee to it, or look unto it, <hi>that ye keep My Sabbath:</hi> then we have the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons annexed.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>It is a ſign between Me and you,</hi> (of which word Sign we have ſpoken already.)</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That ye may know that I am the Lord, that doth ſanctifie you;</hi> as ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Sabbath-bleſſing, or for Me to inſtamp My image of holineſs upon you, <hi>ſee that ye keep holy My Sabbath.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here alſo the frequent iterated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, ye ſhall keep it holy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

So then it is not at every man's liberty if he will obſerve the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or no. God as He is faithful in His promiſes of mercy, ſo alſo in His threatnings of vengeance: Although Sabbath-prophaners may eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, God will aſſuredly (without great repentance) make them ſuffer for ever hereafter, for ſlighting, neglecting and breaking of His Covenant of the Sabbath. For the breaking of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is a violation of the whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:37474:155"/> of God. Wo therefore to thoſe prophane, ungodly Sabbath-breakers, who are alſo uſually addicted to Oaths, Curſings, and Blaſphemies, to Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Drunkenneſs, and other notorious abominations, (for one ſuch hainous ſin never goes alone) <hi>whoſe judgment lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth</hi>

               <p>Wo alſo to thoſe who idle away the Sabbath; ſpending it in worldly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, gadding, gazing, idleneſs, and ſuch-like, as if the negative part of keeping the Sabbath (<hi>thou ſhalt do no manner of work</hi>) were enough: never looking to the poſitive part, to keep it holy, to ſpend the whole day in God's Service, to His glory, and for their own ſpiritual edification and advantage. They that will not ſanctifie God's reſt here, ſhall never enter into His reſt hereafter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Hebrew ſignifies <hi>Ceſſavit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Addition.</note> 
                  <hi>quievit, vacavit;</hi> a Sabbath-day is a day of reſt. It ſignifies not ſuch a reſt, as when one ſitteth ſtill and doth nothing: but a reſting and ceaſing from doing that which he did before. So God called this day a Sabbath, which He dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conſecrated to His own publick Worſhip:</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe on that day God reſted from His creation of all thoſe new ſpecies: but not from conſerving and propagating of them, by the continual generation of individuals.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe the Sabbath is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of that ſpiritual reſt from ſin and of that reſt in everlaſting life.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:37474:159"/>
               <p>3. Becauſe that we muſt on that day ceaſe from all our ſecular and worldly employments; that devoting our ſelves wholly to God's Worſhip, He may work His work upon our hearts, and exerciſe His works in us.</p>
               <p>4. That our Servants and Beaſts may reſt as well as we. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sabbaths, as of Days, Months, and Years.</p>
               <p>1. Their Sabbath of days, every ſeventh day of the Week: So alſo their Sabbaths of days were their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Feſtivals; as the Feaſt of Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Pentecoſt, Tabernacles, Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Trumpets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in all theſe Feaſts they were commanded to reſt as well as on the Seventh day. Of all theſe read at large in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. and 25. Chapters.</p>
               <p>2. Their Sabbath of Months, every New-Moon.</p>
               <p>3. Their Sabbath of years, every ſeventh year, in which they were not to till the ground, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 8. and I may add hereto the Jubilee, which was once in ſeven times ſeven years, or the <hi>49th</hi> year.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>remember</hi> in the Hebrew,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:37474:160"/> ſignifies to call to mind ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or to keep in mind ſomewhat for after; and ſometimes it ſignifies both, as it may well here be taken; for this ordinance of God of the Sabbath, was inſtituted long before, and was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for afterward.</p>
               <p>The word Sanctifie or hallow, doth ſignifie theſe four things.</p>
               <p>1. To make a thing Holy, by putting holineſs into it morally.</p>
               <p>2. To acknowledge a thing to be Holy.</p>
               <p>3. To appoint a thing to Holy and Religious uſes.</p>
               <p>4. To uſe things to thoſe good uſes whereto they were appointed. This day hath no more Holineſs in it, than any other, that for it ſelf it might be accounted more Holy than other: only God hath appointed it to holy uſes, and would have us to uſe it thereunto. The reaſons why God commands us to keep holy this day.</p>
               <p>1. God gives us ſix days to labour in, and hath reſerved but one in ſeven for Himſelf, therefore good reaſon is it we ſhould obey.</p>
               <p>2. God requireth no more, than that which Himſelf hath done, therefore ought men to do ſo.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:37474:160"/>
               <p>3. God hath bleſſed and hallowed this day to this end. Therefore it muſt be kept.</p>
               <p>We muſt ſpend our ſtrength in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Sabbath, in the duties of of the day: they that worſhip God to purpoſe, ſpend their bodies and their ſtrength in nothing ſo much, as in the worſhip of God; ſtirring up themſelves to take hold of God. <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled<note place="margin">Iſai. 64. 7. Gen. 32. 24.</note> with God in Prayer; now wreſtling is a hard exerciſe, therein men put forth all their ſtrength. It will be a ſad thing another day, when this ſhall be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon very many, that they have ſpent their ſtrength upon ſin, and upon their luſts, but never put forth any ſtrength in Holy Duties, or Sabbath-Performances; there they are as cold and dead as may be: It is a ſign of the breath of life when it is warm, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial breath is cold. As the breath that comes out of a living body is warm, but the breath out of a pair bellows is cold: So the breath of many people in Prayer, is diſcovered to be but artificial breath, it is ſo cold: but if there were ſpiritual life, than it would be warm. There muſt be ſtrength and heat of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So I might inſtance in hearing
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:37474:161"/> the Word, we muſt hear as for our lives,<note place="margin">Iſai. 55. 3.</note> ſo hear that our Souls may live, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you will ſay, the Sabbath is a time of reſt?</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is a time of reſt from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward labours, but it is a time of ſpending ſtrength in a ſpiritual way. They that will worſhip God aright upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, will find it a ſpending of a great deal of ſtrength. And bleſſed is that ſtrength that is ſpent in the Worſhip of God.</p>

               <p>1. For Correction; if we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaſtiſement, (whereof all God's<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 8. 10, 11.</note> Children are partakers) then were we baſtards and not ſons.

               <p>2.

                  <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thy ſelf in any wiſe to do evil.</hi> So we ſee that patience is a duty belonging to the Firſt Commandement; not only becauſe it's a part of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience which we owe to God, and he immediately requires it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at our hands: but alſo becauſe that from our acknowledging of God, our confidence in him, and our love and fear of him do follow as neceſſary effects.</p>
               <p>To this Chriſtian patience, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is contrary and oppoſed; which impatience is, when through ignorance or diſtruſt of Gods Wiſdom, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Juſtice and Goodneſs; not to be obedient to God in bearing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities which he hath inflicted upon us; but through grief to fret againſt him, or do ſomething againſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; not craving deliverance or help from him, nor moderating grief by the acknowledging and reſting on his Divine Will; but to yield to grief

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer, This Chriſtian Patience looks on a Three fold Object.</p>
               <p>1. On God, By whoſe Good-will and pleaſure, all adverſities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and from thence come. This <hi>Job</hi> in his afflictions did ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, when he ſaid; <hi>ſhall we</hi>

               <p>2. As Patience looks on men for its Object, or thoſe means in the hand of ſuch inſtruments, whereby evil is brought upon us: There we ought wholly to leave it to God,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 6.</note> For <hi>it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble us: If when we do well, and</hi>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:37474:170"/> of revenge is oppoſed to patience: <hi>Avenge not your ſelves: for it is written,</hi>

                  <hi>vengeance is Mine; I will recompence, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As Patience hath reference to our ſelves; that through the ſenſe of our croſſes and afflictions, we be not tempted to forſake our duty, which is incumbent upon us: we have need of patience; that after we have done the will of God, we might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. To this is oppoſed, when our hearts are broken with afflictions; and from peeviſhneſs there hence, to <hi>turn out</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe without this Patient enduring (for ſo the Greek word ſig-Nifies,) no good thing can be perfected in us. <hi>Let patience in you have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe without patience we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:37474:170"/> poſſeſs our own ſouls; <hi>in</hi> your <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſſeſs ye your ſouls: If thou faint</hi>

                  <hi>in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is ſmall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Becauſe by theſe troubles we are called forth by God who tries us, to combate againſt the Devil, who then (when we have any notable croſs or affliction upon us) will be ſure to tempt<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 32.</note> us. <hi>Call then to remembrance the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days, in which after ye were illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, ye endured a great fight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Now if we are foiled by Satan, it will be a great diſhonour to God, and a great calamity to our ſelves: Therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 21,</note> 
                  <hi>be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Becauſe in this combate, as God will give unto us ſtrength, ſo He will grant us a happy iſſue: <hi>There hath no</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>temptation taken you, but ſuch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto man: but the Lord is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that ye are able; but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſum up all, as we ſaid before; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is a Chriſtian vertue, whereby we willingly ſubmit our ſelves to the pleaſure of God in all things; and with
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:37474:171"/> alacrity and cheerfulneſs go through thoſe troubles which He ſendeth upon us; like obedient children meekly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the correction of our heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>The vices contrary to Patience are,</p>
               <p>1. In defect, murmuring and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency, in grudging to bear whatſoever croſs the Lord ſhall lay upon us.</p>
               <p>2. In exceſs, ſtupidity, in not being touched with, nor profiting under, or by, the Hand of God, when it is upon us.</p>
               <p>This Patience is a vertue, which doth ariſe from our aſſiance and truſt in God; which is a duty enjoyned in the Firſt Commandment.</p>

                  <hi>Pride</hi> is, an inordinate affectation of<note place="margin">Definition of Pride.</note> our own parts or excellency. I will not ſpeak of pride of Apparel, which is childiſh, and very wicked; for apparel is the badge both of our ſin and of our ſhame: Before the Fall, we read, that the man and woman were both naked,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>There is pride, 1. In reference to<note place="margin">Parts of Pride.</note> God. 2. In reference to men. The parts of pride in reference to men are theſe five, 1. Boaſting. 2. Arrogancy. 3. Vain-glory. 4. Ambition. And 5. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>1. If our pride be about thoſe good things which we have, then it is called Boaſting.</p>
               <p>2. If it be about thoſe things which we would ſeem to have, it is called Arrogancy.</p>
               <p>3. If it be concerning our fame and eſteem which we ſeek to have from others, then it is called Vain-glory.</p>
               <p>4. If it be concerning dignities and honours, it is called Ambition.</p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:37474:173"/>
               <p>5. If it be concerning getting of things which do exceed our own ſtrength and power, then it is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>This affectation of our own parts<note place="margin">How it is ſhewed.</note> worth or excellency, is ſhewed 2 ways.</p>
               <p>1. When a man lifteth up himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another.</p>
               <p>2. When he arrogateth to himſelf ſomething above himſelf. In the former of theſe a man is proud either directly or indirectly.</p>
               <p>1. Directly, when he ſimply prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelf above another.</p>
               <p>2. Indirectly and interpretatively, when he will not ſubmit himſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom he ought to be ſubject. In this laſt reſpect, as it is pride againſt man, not to be ſubject to Superiours and Magiſtrates whom he ought to ſubmit unto, which he is enjoyned to do, and<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> that for Conſcience ſake. So alſo it brancheth it ſelf out in the ſecond place in reference to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Pride againſt God is ſhewed when men will not be ſubject to God's Will, and refuſe to hear and obey His Word. <hi>Then ſpake all the proud men</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is another ſort of pride alſo ſimply againſt God, when a man is proud of his Gifts and Graces, or of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties, or any enlarged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therein; which of all pride is moſt deviliſh. O watch thy heart here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt; (for Satan will be apt to tempt thee; <hi>leſt thou fall into the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

               <p>But to ſpeak a little more of pride towards men, which we ſhould have done before; and then to proceed in ſpeaking more fully of pride immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards God.</p>
               <p>Pride in reference to men, is toward Superiours, or Inferiours, or Equals.</p>
               <p>1. Toward Superiours, when proud men will not be ſubject to them.</p>
               <p>2. Toward Inferiours, when they will not behave themſelves ſo towards them, as is meet; but ſcorn them and trample upon them.</p>
               <p>3. Toward Equals, when they deſire
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:37474:174"/> to be, or ſeem to be higher than they.</p>
               <p>This pride is either in heart, or in ſpeeches, or in outward geſture.</p>
               <p>1. In the heart; then it is called a lifting up of the heart, ſo it is ſpoken of <hi>Amaziah;</hi> when he had ſmitten the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>

               <p>2. In ſpeeches, then it is called boaſting; when a man's own tongue<note place="margin">Prov. 20: 6.</note> proclaimeth his own goodneſs.</p>
               <p>3. In outward geſtures; <hi>The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Iſai. 3. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeak a little more of pride againſt God: Oh this pride! Some learned men do hold, that it was this ſin of Pride, that did caſt the Angels out of Heaven: miſtaking that place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 14. 13, 14. which is meant of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The ſin of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels comprehended pride, envy, and more too; Being an utter falling away from God, and that holy ſtanding which God had placed them in; eſpecially to miniſter to man's good. So alſo pride was a great ingredient in the ſin of our firſt Parents; though in general it was
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:37474:174"/> diſobedience: the degrees whereof were, firſt infidelity; then pride; and laſtly, the diſavowing of ſubjection to God;<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16, 17. &amp; 3. 6, 7.</note> by eating the forbidden fruit: which they imagined ſhould be the means to attain to a higher degree of bleſſedneſs; but proved to be the ſin that procured their fall. Thus we ſee the riſe and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of pride; and how odious it is to God; and the dreadful conſequences of it. It made the Angels become De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: and God ſpared them not, but<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.</note> threw them out of heaven, and <hi>caſt them down to hell, and delivered them into</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. With the conſideration of the greatneſs and power of God; the ſerious apprehenſion thereof, will make us vile<note place="margin">Job. 42. 5, 6. Rom. 9. 20. 21.</note> in our own eyes, and to abhor our ſelves in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>2. So the ſecond means is, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our own vileneſs.</p>
               <p>3. The conſideration of thoſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and tyes by which we are bound to ſubject our ſelves wholly to God; as
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:37474:177"/> He is our Creator, Up-holder, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and our Lord.</p>
               <p>4. The conſideration of God's wrath and indignation againſt all proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and His grace and favour toward the humble.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſecond Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral acceptations of Grace in Scripture. But to wave them: Grace in God, is His eternal favour and good-will, which is the well-ſpring of all the benefits we have. So we have it (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.) according to His own purpoſe and Grace: So (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.) if of Grace, then not of works. This is the Grace of Election, which makes us gracious and acceptable unto God.</p>
               <p>There is alſo Grace freely given; as the gifts of the Spirit freely beſtowed upon us: ſo we are bid to <hi>grow in Grace.</hi> So alſo faith, with all the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> effects and fruits thereof; which are called Grace; becauſe they are freely given unto us. So alſo the free imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 20, 21.</note> of Chriſt's righteouſneſs (or our juſtification) is by God's Grace, and called the Grace of God, which hath abounded unto many.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:37474:178"/>
               <p>By the name of Grace we uſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the free favour of God in Chriſt, and His gifts from that Grace; whether given to believers, as ingraffing into the body of Chriſt by His Spirit, remiſſion of ſins, final perſeverance or to hold out unto the end, and in the end eternal life. Theſe gifts are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, but only to thoſe who are in His Grace and favour, that is, to true believers. But corporal and temporal good things are given to many, yea, to thoſe that are not true believers, and have no faith whereby men alone may pleaſe God.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some do underſtand by Grace in this place, favour and acceptation with God<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 80.</note> and men: So we read that <hi>Jeſus grew in Grace and ſavour with God and men,</hi> ſo it is in the Original. The <hi>Lord will give</hi> his people <hi>grace and glory,</hi> and <hi>no good thing will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>walk uprightly.</hi> So God gives grace to the humble, makes them accepted and favoured with God and men. Briefly Grace in Scripture is uſed three ways.</p>
               <p>1. For comelineſs, ſtature, meekneſs, or mildneſs.</p>
               <p>2. For free favour whereby one em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth another, pardoning former inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:37474:178"/> and receiving the party offending into favour. So <hi>Gen. 6. 8. Noah found grace in the eyes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For all kinds of gifts and graces which of God's free favour are given, whether temporal or eternal, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. So I underſtand that grace is taken here. Now to ſpeak of humility, we have the ſame expreſſion in St. <hi>Peter</hi> as is here. <hi>All of you be ſubject one to another, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>be clothed with humility; for God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A humble man ſignifies one lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,<note place="margin">A deſcription of Humility.</note> eſteeming others better than himſelf, aſcribing all unto God; being little in his own eyes or account, even as a weaned child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Chariot-driver is the ſpirit of Pride; and all they that are lovers of this preſent world, are carried in this Chariot: the horſes of this Chariot are unbridled; the wheels are very ſlippery; the Chariot-driver very perverſe and furious; and they that are carried therein, very infirm and weak perſons. Therefore this ſin of Pride is to be cut down and grubbed up even at the very roots, leſt hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſecretly it riſing up, it grow and increaſe by our allowing and bearing with it, and ſo become ſtronger by uſe and cuſtome, much care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is required againſt it.</p>
               <p>Pride overthrew the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> confounded our Speech; proſtrated <hi>Goliah;</hi> hanged <hi>Haman;</hi> ſlew <hi>Nicanor;</hi> killed <hi>Antiochus;</hi> drowned <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> made <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> like a beaſt; <hi>Herod</hi> to be eaten up with worms; ruined ſtately Cities and Palaces; and

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:37474:185"/> of them is loſt.

Becauſe Chriſt reſtoreth all theſe things to us, therefore they are accounted from another, and not from nature, and therefore were once taken away. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not taken away by the fall, but it was exceedingly corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, that only foul ruines thereof do now appear. <hi>The light ſhined in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the darkneſs comprehended it not:</hi> In the perverted and degenerate nature of man, there ſhine yet ſome ſparks, which ſhew him to be a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, differing from brutes, becauſe he is endued with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet that light is choaked with great and thick miſts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that it cannot effectually get abroad. I might farther expatiate on this, but it is not to our preſent purpoſe. All this is to ſhew that man hath no cauſe to be proud. If we have any ſpiritual gifts or graces in us, it is wholly from God: If thou haſt received
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:37474:185"/> them, why boaſteſt thou as if thou hadſt not received them? Therefore Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a precious vertue and an excellent grace, becauſe in acknowledging of mans vileneſs, Gods Highneſs is exalted. We can never be righteous till we be humble, nor humble ſo long as we build on our own righteouſneſs. There is no way open for us to Salvation, before we have laid away our pride; for God will bring down high looks, but He will<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 28. &amp; 25. 9. Iſa. 57. 15.</note> ſave the humble: God will inſtruct and teach them; manifeſt Himſelf to them, and dwell with them. Chriſt thought it not ſufficient to teach humility in words, but ſets it out in a Parable, as in a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted table the image and portraicture of true humility; when He brings in the <hi>Publican, ſtanding afar off,</hi> not daring to<note place="margin">Luke 18. 3.</note> lift up his eyes to heaven, <hi>but ſmiting on his breaſt,</hi> and praying on this wiſe, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> We may not think theſe were tokens of feigned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, that he dared not look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or come nearer, that with ſmiting his breaſt he confeſſeth himſelf a ſinner; but they be teſtimonies of true humility and inward affection Chriſt was alſo ſent into the world with this commiſſion<note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1.</note> to bring glad tidings to the <hi>poor,</hi> to <hi>heal

               <p>They are far from the diſpoſition of<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> the <hi>Publican:</hi> Chriſt never came into the world for them; He had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion<note place="margin">&amp; 9. 12, 13.</note> from His Father on their behalf: According to His commiſſion, He call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none but them that <hi>are weary and heavy-laden</hi> (with the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their ſins) to be partakers of His bounty and liberality. <hi>He came not to call the righteous;</hi> (thoſe that are puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up, highly conceited, and proud of themſelves and their own righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>but ſinners to repentance:</hi> (that is, thoſe that ſee their ſins, bewail them, and are humbled under them, labouring under the weight of them; and ſeeing their own inability and inſufficiency in the buſineſs of Salvation, bring their poor

                  <item>1. Nothing makes us more acceptable to God and men, than lowlineſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</item>
                  <item>2. We are moſt precious in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when we are moſt low and vile in our own eyes.</item>
                  <item>3. He that willingly doth not walk humbly here, ſhall never be exalted to glory in heaven.</item>
                  <item>4. This excellent grace of humility makes the mind free from pinching cares here, and ſecure from threatned puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter.</item>
                  <item>5. Humiliation or humbling is the way to humility; even as patience is the way to peace, and much reading is the way to knowledge.</item>
                  <item>6. If thou therefore deſireſt this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of humility, do not ſhun or flee from the way of humiliation.</item>
                  <item>7. He that is truly humble, leſt others ſhould think of him more or better than he is, will be ſeemingly ignorant of that which is in himſelf.</item>
                  <item>8. When thou ſeeſt and findeſt
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:37474:187"/> thy ſelf truly humbled, thou haſt a ſure ſign and good argument of grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, for God will give grace to the humble.</item>
                  <item>9. Lay the foundation of humility low here, which is the way to the height of glory hereafter. <hi>Job</hi> 22. 19.</item>
                  <item>10. Will thou attain the height and excellency of the higheſt heavens? learn of thy Saviour, who was <hi>meek and lowly in heart,</hi> and follow His humility.</item>
                  <item>11. Here behold the honey of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the ſweetneſs of meekneſs; for even as honey well agrees with Phyſical confections for all diverſities of Species; ſo all ſorts of ventues are ſeaſoned with the ſweetneſs of humility.</item>
                  <item>12. The higheſt humility is ſeen in this, when in all things we willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſubmit our wills to Gods will.</item>
                  <item>13. By humility the members of Chriſt know how to overcome the pride of the Devil.</item>
                  <item>14. Thou canſt never be a good Schollar, or proſicient in the School of Chriſt without humility.</item>

And many Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives our Saviour uſeth to diſſwade us from it. As</p>
               <p>1. From the <hi>fowls of the air; which ſow not, nor reap, nor gather into barnes;</hi> and <hi>yet our heavenly Father feedeth them:</hi> and <hi>are not we much better than they?</hi>

                  </gap>th us, that we are of ſo <hi>little faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. From the Heathen and Gentiles,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:37474:188"/> (which have no knowledge of the true God, no intereſt in His promiſe;) this is enough for them ſollicitouſly to ſeek after theſe things.</p>
               <p>5. Our <hi>heavenly Father knows that we have need of theſe things;</hi> and ſo ſhall have while we are here in this life: for God knows as we have ſouls, ſo bodies alſo, which have need of ſuſtentation, food and rayment, which are needful for us. And God hath promiſed, not to deny us things which are needful.</p>
               <p>6. If we in the firſt place do <hi>ſeek the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, all theſe things ſhall be added unto us;</hi> and given in as an advantage; for they are but acceſſive, and muſt come in in the ſecond place.</p>
               <p>7. Our Saviour iterateth His charge unto us; <hi>therefore take no thought for the morrow; for the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf: ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto the day is the evil thereof.</hi> Therefore let us not be troubled through the care and apprehenſion of future time; which is a diſtruſtful, a vain, unprofitable, and ſinful care. Time preſent is only ours; for the future, what ſhall betide either us or ours, is known only to God, who hath times,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:37474:189"/> events, and ſeaſons in His own hand.</p>
               <p>There is a Two-fold care of the things of this life.</p>
               <p>1. A care of diffidence, diſtruſting Gods providence, mercy and goodneſs, which is here condemned.</p>
               <p>2. A care of diligence, to uſe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and diligence in our places and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the ſupply of our wants, and of thoſe who depend upon us, with a moderate care, and that in reference to Gods command; and reſting on His providence, promiſes, bleſſings and goodneſs: This care is good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; ſo it be moderate, not to hinder us from, or interrupt us in our holy duties.</p>
               <p>We know it is Gods Ordinance, <hi>in the ſweat of our face to eat our bread;</hi> to<note place="margin">Gen 3. 19.</note> uſe pains, diligence and induſtry: And the Apoſtle commands, <hi>that if any will</hi>

               <p>Irregular cares are both ſuperfluous, and alſo ſinful.</p>
               <p>1. Superfluous; for as unto us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the induſtry, but the care belongs unto God: unto us, the labour and uſe of lawful means; but unto God, the bleſſing and ſucceſs of all. God muſt be truſted with the events of all our pains and induſtry: our cares can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring to paſs our ſmalleſt deſires: the care of events was ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and belongs wholly to His providence.</p>
               <p>2. As irregular cares are ſuperfluous, ſo alſo ſinful too: for they are worldly, diſtruſting of Gods providence; they<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 3.</note> are adulterous cares, ſtealing away the heart from God; they take off the heart from the word, and make it become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful. In all theſe, and other reſpects, they are ſinful; and we ought to arm our ſelves againſt them.

                  <hi>every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanks giving, let our requeſts be made known unto God:</hi> And our <hi>God ſhall ſupply all our need, according to His riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Yet let us uſe the means; and be diligent in the works of our calling. Now in the labour and works of our calling, there is required a double action of faith.</p>
               <p>1. To do our labour in good manner, that is, to the glory of God, and the good of men with whom we live.</p>
               <p>2. In our dayly labours to reſtrain and moderate our care.</p>
               <p>Men commonly take upon them a double care, as Firſt to do the works and labours of their callings. Secondly, to procure a bleſſing and good ſucceſs to their labours.</p>
               <p>But faith in God, where it reigns, it ſtirs up the hearts of men, only to the firſt care; which is the faithful diſcharge of their labours and duties in their place: And it reſtrains them from the ſecond, for a bleſſing and good ſucceſs;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:37474:191"/> and makes them to leave that wholly to God. For when men have done their duty which appertains unto them; then Faith makes them without any more ado, to wait upon God for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; which (as we ſaid before) is Gods part, as the former (which is the faithful diſcharge of our duties in our places) is our part.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>caſt thy burden</hi>

                  <hi>upon the Lord, and He ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this faith whereby we depend upon God for the ſucceſs of our labours, hath an infallible ground; namely, that God beſt knows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our wants, and He will give us all things which He in His Wiſdom knows to be neceſſary for us. So Chriſt ſaith, <hi>your heavenly Father</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>knows that we have need of theſe things.</hi> There is no want to thoſe that fear Him:<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> If men by faith would build on theſe promiſes, they need not like drudges of the world; toyl and ſpend themſelves, and the beſt part of their days in worldly cares, ſo as they do: For they ſhould have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſing from God, with leſs care, if they would truſt Him: and alſo they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:37474:191"/> ſhould have far more time than they have, to care for heaven and heavenly things.</p>
               <p>It is not ſaid this or that place is the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note> Lords, <hi>but the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> Therefore ſeeing we believe God to be our Father, and our heavenly Father, (ſo He is able and willing to hear and help us;) this ſhould moderate our care for the things of this life: For if we know our ſelves to be the children of God, then we muſt alſo know that God will provide for us: As we know in a family, the father of the family provideth for all thoſe of his houſhold: God is the great houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper of all the earth. He <hi>provideth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Raven his food; when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of meat. He giveth to the beaſt his food;</hi>

If we ſhould ſee a young man provide for himſelf, and no one elſe for him; ſurely we would ſay his Father is dead: even ſo, when a mans care both day and night, is ſet wholly for the things of this life: it argues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:37474:192"/> that God hath caſt him off, or elſe that he takes God for no Father of his.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Lord doth thus take care of His Children, and provideth for them all kind of benefits: What a horrid wickedneſs is it, for men to get their living by ungodly means, as lying, cheating, fraud, carding, dicing, and ſuch like exerciſes? If a man were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God were his Father, and would provide ſufficiently both for his ſoul and body; ſo that uſing lawful means, he ſhould ever have enough; out of all doubt, he would never after the faſhion of the world, uſe unlawful and profane means to get a living. But this plainly evidenceth, that however ſuch men ſay, that God is their Father, yet indeed they deny Him.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour in the Fourth Petition of the Lords Prayer, teaches us to pray to our heavenly Father, <hi>to give us this day our dayly bread.</hi> Where bread, (by a Synecdoche very uſual to the Hebrews) ſignifies all corporal good things neceſſary for this life; as food, clothing, health, peace, and ſuch like: and alſo a good uſe of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore all theſe good things, Chriſt comprehends under the name of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:37474:192"/> 
                  <hi>Bread,</hi> and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>To bridle our luſts; that only bread is to be pray'd for; only things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſuſtentation of this life, whereby we may be the better enabled to ſerve God and our Neighbour, in our Vocation and Calling; whether in our general calling as we are Chriſtians, or in our particular calling, in that place and calling God hath ſet us in.</p>
               <p>2. To teach us alſo, to beg of God, the wholſom and good uſe of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</p>
               <p>So then, in the Fourth Petition, when we beg Bread of God: it ſignifies,</p>
               <p>1. Not great riches, but only things neceſſary; ſuch a proportion of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance, credit, liberty, health, wealth,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8.</note> food and rayment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is convenient for us. And that with condition, if God ſee it fit for us, and if it be His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and pleaſure. Which exception is a caution proper to this Petition for outward things.</p>
               <p>2. We beg hereby, that theſe things may be bread to us; that is, that by the bleſſing of God, they may be wholſom and good unto us.</p>
               <p>And we beg our bread, not anothers; that which God ſees fir for us; which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:37474:193"/> we may call our own. God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Family, diſtributeth to every one a portion; which we beg may be given to us: And our bread, bread got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by our own labour and induſtry, that ſo we may eat the labour of our<note place="margin">Pſal. 128<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 1 Theſ. 4. 11. 2 Theſ. 3. 12.</note> own hands; and eat our own bread. And ſo that is called our bread which comes to us, by the bleſſing of God on our lawful endeavours; ſo that neither God nor Man can juſtly implead us for it.</p>
               <p>And that we may uſe it with a good conſcience, and with giving of thanks: <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteal no more, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why do we pray, <hi>Give us this day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That we may be taken off, from diſtruſt and covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>2. That we may depend on God alone, and beg things neceſſary from Him, and expect them wholly from Him.</p>
               <p>3. That the exerciſe of Faith and Prayer may be daily continued in us.</p>
               <p>4. We Pray for <hi>This day,</hi> to teach us to Pray for Bread for a day, not for a moneth or a year; ſo to teach us for to reſtrain our care, that it reach not too far: but to reſt on God's Providence, and preſent bleſſings; and ſo not to be covetous.</p>
               <p>Hereby we profeſs the moderation of our care and deſire of earthly things; with our purpoſe every day, by Labour and Prayer, to ſeek theſe bleſſings at the hands of God.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:37474:194"/>
               <p>Here alſo our affections are forbidden to paſs meaſure; not to have a carking and troubling care; ſeeing the preſent<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 34.</note> vexation of the day is enough for it ſelf: But to commit our ways to God, and<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 5. Prov. 16. 3.</note> to rowle all our matters upon Him, who will bring them all to paſs.</p>
               <p>So here we ſee, that a moderate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and deſire of having theſe earthly things, and a moderate care of procuring them, is approved and required;<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 28. 2 Cor. 12. 13, 14.</note> that we may not be burdenſome, but rather helpful unto others.</p>
               <p>There are two extreams hereof; (we muſt know that every virtue is a middle between two extreams.)</p>
               <p>1. The firſt extream is careleſsneſs and neglect of our goods and eſtate. For as he is commended who gathereth in ſeaſonable times; ſo he is much blamed<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 5. &amp; 6. 6.</note> who neglecteth thoſe opportunities: and is cenſured by the Apoſtle, to be <hi>worſe than an infidel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. The ſecond extream is, an anxious and ſolicitous care (of which before we ſpake) which diſtracteth the mind, that it cannot wholly be intent to God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as is required.</p>
               <p>And this doth partly ariſe from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and partly from diffidence and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:37474:194"/> diſtruſt in God's Promiſes and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as before we ſaid.</p>
               <p>So we muſt regulate our deſires of theſe outward things, in ſubſerviency to God's Will, His Glory, and our own Salvation, and to deſire heavenly things in the firſt place, before and above all earthly things. Spiritual things we may pray for abſolutely; and there let us open our mouthes wide, be large in our deſires for them, and God will fill us. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 10. Mat. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> God takes it well at our hands, when we ask heavenly things in the firſt place, then He will give us earthly things as an advantage. So God did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe he asked not riches, or honour, or the necks of his enemies; but becauſe he asked Wiſdom, therefore ſaid the Lord, <hi>Wiſdom and knowledg is granted unto thee; and I will give thee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 1. 10, 11, 12.</note>

                  </hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Take we heed yet, that we ſeek not earthly things inordinately, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earneſtly,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe I dye:</hi> Nor to ſeek them by ſinful or unlawful means, to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of our ſouls, and everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:37474:195"/>
               <p>A Chriſtian can be ſet in no eſtate or condition, wherein the abundant care of God is not ſeen over him; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the greateſt ſtraights, He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greateſt care of us: As water runs ſtrongeſt in the narroweſt paſſages; ſo when we walk in darkneſs, and have<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 10.</note> no light; when we <hi>ſeek water, and there is none, and our tongue faileth for thirſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 17.</note> then is Gods fitteſt time to help us; and then is our moſt needful time to ſtay our ſelves upon Him. God many times takes our extremity for His opportunity to do us good: <hi>In the mount will the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Many will ſay, they truſt in God; aye, but moſt commonly it is, when their Coffers and Barns are full; then it is an eaſie thing for them to ſay, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God: But the tryal of a Chriſtians Faith, is, if God doth ſtrip him naked and bare of worldly comforts and enjoyments, deprives him of humane helps; <hi>yet then to reſt on the Name of</hi>

               <p>Now a word of the Providence of God, and I have done.</p>
               <p>I intend not to ſpeak of His Eternal<note place="margin">Providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> Providence, the good-will and council of God, as <hi>Acts 4. 28. Eph.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>But of His actual Providence, which is nothing elſe, than the execution of the Decrees of God.</p>
               <p>Or the Actual Providence of God, is, whereby God doth not only preſerve, ſuſtaine, and uphold His creatures; but according to His immenſe Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power, Juſtice and Mercy, He governeth them all.</p>
               <p>Whoever deny this Providence of God, deny God Himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Providence is far different from the Fate of the <hi>Stoicks:</hi> Now I mention the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak but a word of the Opinions of the Heathens here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. There were 3. Opinions of the Philoſophers about the Providence of God.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Epicureans,</hi> they deny'd any Providence at all, over any of theſe things here below in the world.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> have deviſed in ſtead
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:37474:198"/> of Providence, an abſolute neceſſity of all things and motions, exiſting in the very nature of things themſelves; to which not only all other things, but alſo God Himſelf is ſubject: which neceſſity they call Fate.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> they ſay, that God beholdeth and underſtandeth all things; He doth moderate and rule all; but that He only ordereth the heavenly motions, and by theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heavens, He puts a power of acting into the inferior or lower parts of Nature, meaning thoſe things here below, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall inſiſt no farther on theſe; deſiring to be underſtood of the meaneſt capacity, and that to edifie.</p>
               <p>Theſe great learned Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, became vain in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> and <hi>profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe they became fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So we ſee the Stoical Fate bindeth God to the connexion of ſecond cauſes: But the Chriſtian Fate (if I may call it ſo,) doth make ſecond cauſes ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the moſt free-will of God.</p>
               <p>The parts of Providence are Two, 1. Conſervation. 2. Gubernation: but I muſt not expatiate upon theſe now.</p>
               <p>Let us learn to depend on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence

               <p>1. The preparation unto death, is an action of a repentant Sinner, whereby he makes himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is a duty very neceſſary, to which we are bound by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Therefore we are bid to watch and pray. As death leaves us, ſo

               <p>Or more briefly thus: It ſhall be a manifeſtation of all hearts, and a laying open of all things which men have done; and a ſeparating of the wicked from the godly, paſſing Sentence upon All, and Execution of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to the Doctrine of the Law and Goſpel: Which will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deliverance and perpetual bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Godly; and a caſting of the Wicked and Devils into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhment.

               <p>For, 1. The elect ſhall not have their ſins remembred, Chriſt having ſatisfied for them: <hi>All their tranſgreſſions that</hi>

               <p>So then, men ſhall be adjudged to ſalvation or damnation, for their works ſake.</p>

               <p>2. That God may obtain the end of creation of man: God made all men for His glory; if wicked men would not glorifie Him here, He will judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be glorified upon them in their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:37474:217"/> everlaſting confuſion: God ſhall be praiſed and glorified by His Elect to all eternity.</p>
               <p>3. That God may ſhew His perfect goodneſs and mercy to His Elect, who were ſo excruciated, troubled, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted here in this world, that they may<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 8.</note> have reſt.</p>
               <p>4. For His perfect Juſtice and Truths ſake, that He may ſhew His Juſtice in puniſhing the ungodly, who do flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in this world, where they have all<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25.</note> the good that ever they ſhall have. Therefore it muſt be according to God's Juſtice and Truth in His Promiſes, that the righteous ſhall have recompence in everlaſting life, both in body and ſoul.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer: Chriſt alone in His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſhall appear, judg and pronounce the ſentence on all, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it; yet not excluding the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; God is inviſible. For this judgment is the work of the whole individual Trinity; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the viſible act, promulgation, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:37474:218"/> execution of the ſentence, ſo it is the judgment of Chriſt. For Chriſt being viſibly ſeen of all, ſhall paſs ſentence, and execute it on all.

               </p>
               <p>God ſo of His gracious good will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth glory, that none ſhall have
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:37474:224"/> cauſe of complaint for want of glory, nor of envying others that have more.</p>
               <p>Chriſt after the day of Judgment ſhall remain King for ever; for He ſhall not ſo <hi>deliver up the Kingdom to His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24.</note> that He ſhall ceaſe to reign: But that He may repreſent to His Father, that His Kingdom is compleat, and ſhall remain ſo for ever. The meaning of thoſe words is thus, when Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, hath been, eſtabliſhed King of the whole World, but eſpecially of His Church, to gather together, govern, and bring unto His Father all His Elect, and to deſtroy His enemies; ſhall have brought His work to an end, <hi>and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Kingdom to His Father,</hi> that (as verſe 28.) <hi>God may be all in all;</hi> that is, the Father, with the Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in Unity of Eſſence and Glory, ſhall begin to reign immediately over His Church, in a manner, altogether new; namely by Himſelf, without any outward means, without the work of Angels or Men, Eccleſiaſtical or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Orders, as it is in this world; and likewiſe without any adverſaries or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; filling all His with His light, love, life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glory. Which indeed will not a whit diſannul Chriſts Kingdom,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:37474:224"/> but only change the meaner form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, into a more ſublime, majeſtical, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and moſt perfect form, <hi>That God may be all in all;</hi> that is, that God, the whole bleſſed Trinity, may immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely work fully, in all the Elect, who ſhall then be perfectly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God; and that He may Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, Govern, and Rule them for ever.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeak a little, where theſe glorious manſions are, in Heaven. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpeak of ten Heavens; but we ſhall wave that, and ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture-phraſe, and ſo there are three Heavens.<note place="margin">3 Heavens.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, all that whole ſpace from the earth, to the ſphere of the Moon, where the birds flie; therefore they are called the <hi>folws of Heaven:</hi> and whence<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 26.</note> the rain, hail, and ſnow, thunder and lightning, wind, and other Meteors do deſcend.

               <p>The ſecond Heaven is, and conſiſts of all thoſe viſible Orbs, where the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 14. 15. Gen. 1. 8.</note> and <hi>God called the firmament, Heaven:</hi> and in this God hath placed the Sun, Moon, and other Stars, which

               </p>
               <p>The third Heaven is that where God is ſaid eſpecially to dwell, whither Chriſt <hi>aſcended,</hi> whither St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2.</note> rapture was caught up into this <hi>third Heaven,</hi> and where all the bleſſed ones ſhall be for ever.

               <p>The Papiſts feign a Purgatory, that<note place="margin">Solution.</note> they may be purged from their ſins: which is contrary to the Scripture. For the Scripture teacheth us, that not the ſire of Purgatory after this life (of which there is no mention made in Scripture) but the blood of Chriſt laid hold on, and applied by a lively faith while we are here in this life, doth cleanſe our ſouls from all ſin: And<note place="margin">1 John 1. 7.</note> that the ſouls of the faithful after death are not thruſt into a place of torment, but that they are gathered unto Chriſt, into <hi>Abrahams boſome.</hi> The meaning<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 23.</note> of [<hi>into Abrahams boſome</hi>] is thus, it is the geſture of a good Father towards
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:37474:225"/> his little and tender Children, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them in his boſome. The ſouls of the faithful preſently after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the body, are carry'd by the Angels up into heaven; into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all true believers, of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Titular Father, and therefore called <hi>the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16:</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, That preſently after death, the ſoul appears before God to Judgment,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7.</note> either to be gathered into the Manſions of the bleſſed, or to be caſt into Hell, into the ſtate of the damned; from whence there is no redemption: and then truly are tormented in thoſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames; but yet are reſerved for greater torments againſt the laſt Day, when ſoul and body ſhall be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again. And for this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very clear. So our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Father into Thy hands I commit my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>

               <p>And this is the laſt Article of Faith, as the Crown of all; <hi>I believe the life everlaſting,</hi> or that there is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life: which holds out theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. I believe that after this life there ſhall be another life, in which all the true members of the Church ſhall be glorifi'd, and ſhall praiſe God for <hi>ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I believe that I am a member of this Church, and ſo ſhall be a partaker of <hi>everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That in this life I have by Faith, the beginning of everlaſting life: For Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that believeth in Me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>hath everlaſting life:</hi> So this profit and comfort hence redoundeth unto me, that in and through Chriſt I am juſtifi'd before God, and am an <hi>heir of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi>

                     </gap>orth know we Him no more:</hi> that is, not with an affection meerly humane, civil, and natural; but wholly with a Divine and ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:37474:226"/> befitting the ſtate of glory.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed this, I anſwer in this Syllogiſm; We ſhall enjoy in heaven every good thing, and comfortable gift, which may any way increaſe or add to our joy and happineſs:</p>
               <p>But meeting in heaven with our old dear Chriſtian friends, knowing of them, and enjoying them, never to part more either with them, or all other the glorious Inhabitants in thoſe heavenly Manſions, will raviſh us with ſweeteſt delight:</p>
               <p>Therefore we ſhall know one another in heaven; nay our minds being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enlightned with all wiſdom and knowledg, we ſhall be able to know not only thoſe holy perſons of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer relation or acquaintance; but alſo ſuch as we never knew before in the fleſh, even all the faithful which ever were, are, or ſhall be. We ſhall be able then to ſay, This was <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob, Samuel, David,</hi> &amp;c. This was my Father, Mother, this was my child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was he that occaſioned my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, who taught me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this may clearly be gathered out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>1. For if <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, had
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:37474:227"/> that meaſure of Illumination, <hi>That he knew Eve,</hi> and from whence ſhe came<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> at the firſt ſight; much more we (who then ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and with wiſdom) ſhall know each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the Saints whom we never ſaw before in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now we ſee as through a glaſs darkly,</hi>

                  <hi>but then face to face; now we know in part, but then ſhall we know even as alſo we are known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Chriſt in His Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had then a taſt and glimps of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and were able thereby to know <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> whom they had never ſeen, who lived many hundred of years before; neither could they know their viſage by ſtatues or pictures, which was a thing utterly forbidden to the <hi>Jews:</hi> but by the alone grace and favour of God, which put into their hearts this immediate light of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; How much more ſhall we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully enlightned, and perfectly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in heaven, know exactly all the bleſſed ones, though never acquainted with them here upon the earth?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Samuel</hi> being inſpired by God,<note place="margin">

                     </gap> Sam. 9. 17.</note> knew <hi>Saul</hi> whom he had never ſeen before.</p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:37474:227"/>
               <p>4. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in his Mother <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s womb, <hi>leap'd for joy,</hi> to<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 41.</note> hear the voice of the bleſſed Virgin, the Mother of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If the minds of theſe were ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the beams of the Spirit, and did ſo; ſhall not we much more know each other in heaven, when all clouds and miſts of darkneſs ſhall be wholly taken away, and we ſhall be fully illuminated and glorified?</p>
               <p>5. Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews, That they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and all the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the kingdom of heaven,</hi> therefore they muſt know them.</p>
               <p>6. And it is clearly gathered out of the Parable in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 23, 24, 25, that the Saints do know the Saints in the Kingdom of heaven: and the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in torments do know each other.</p>
               <p>In this knowledg each of other, the heap of reward encreaſeth. For as the Elect do more and more rejoyce when they ſee thoſe whom they have loved on earth, to rejoyce with them; ſo the wicked in Hell, when they ſee whom they dearly loved in this world, to be tormented with them; not only their own puniſhment, but the puniſhment of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:37474:228"/> thoſe whom they ſo much loved in this life, adds unto their miſery.</p>
               <p>Where-hence we conclude, that the glorified Saints, then plentifully endu'd with all knowledg, and ſupernaturally enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall know each other, and thoſe Saints alſo whom they never knew in the fleſh. There all men ſhall be known of every ſeveral man, of what Nation, Country or ſtock ſoever he came; and every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man ſhall be known of all. We ſhall know the ſpiritual ſubſtances, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, orders, and excellencies of the holy Angels. And the nature, immortality, operations, and originals of our own ſouls; yea, and all things knowable. But above all, we ſhall be beatifically enlightned with a clear and glorious ſight of God Himſelf, which Divines call the <hi>Beatifical Viſion;</hi> which alone makes us bleſſed and happy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: Beholding the inexpreſſible glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, iſſuing from His glorious Face; whereby we ſhall be wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken with His Beauty, and our ſouls inwardly raviſhed with the things that we ſhall behold, with a delight of them: and nothing ſhall be able to make our joys either to faint or to fail. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:37474:228"/> after that Chriſt hath crowned all the Elect with crowns of glory, then every one taking the crown from his head, ſhall lay it down at the feet of Chriſt, proſtrating themſelves, and with one heart and voice, in a heavenly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſhall ſay, <hi>Praiſe and honour, glory and power be unto Thee O bleſſed Lamb, who ſetteſt upon the Throne: Who haſt Redeemed us to God by Thy bloud; out of every kindred, and tongue, and</hi>
